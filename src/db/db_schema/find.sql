It will be done via the money counts database.  Ms. Annie Howell from Eno River helped us test it (thanks Annie).    If you have sent me any request any the last weeks, they have not been processed and you will need to follow this new procedure. \r\n\r\nThis new procedure helps to hold staff accountable in regards to giving and receiving the purchasing guidelines whether they are for regular funding or CI funding.  It also brings back information about each employee in relation to their park location and job title and etc.  If they are not listed in the division personnel  database, no p-card can be requested.   \r\n\r\nIt requires the OA, the employee and the Superintendent to do approvals on line (the DNCR request form is still required to be completed as normal and has changed so make sure you have used the most up to date form which the OA must print out from money counts).  \r\n\r\nOA or Cashier can only start the process as per below (if you are not listed as a cashier in the cash handling plan, you canâ€™t proceed) \r\n\r\nâ€¢	OA logs into Money Counts\r\nâ€¢	Click on P-Card Button at top of page \r\nâ€¢	Click on Card Request \r\nâ€¢	Click on Instructions\r\nâ€¢	Follow Instructions 1 to 7 (downloading all forms and giving them to employee. No other forms are allowed so make sure staff come to you)\r\nâ€¢	Click on new request and follow all prompts (if both a regular card and CI card is required, must complete a form and request for each type)\r\nâ€¢	Need to let Employee know thy now need to log into money counts. \r\n\r\nEmployee Requirement:\r\nâ€¢	Employee must log into money counts\r\nâ€¢	Click on My Reports\r\nâ€¢	Click on PCARD HOLDER GUIDELINES VERIFICATION (you have another opportunity to view all purchasing guidelines and can always print the most up to date copies from here)\r\nâ€¢	Click  the checkbox and submit\r\nâ€¢	Now need to let manager know to log into money counts. \r\n\r\nSuperintendent/Manger requirement\r\nâ€¢	logs into Money Counts\r\nâ€¢	Clicks on P-Card Button at top of page \r\nâ€¢	Click on Card Request \r\nâ€¢	See request with an â€œUpdateâ€ link for you to click on\r\nâ€¢	Input a justification\r\nâ€¢	Click on approve checkbox and submit\r\n\r\nDPR BUDGET OFFICE:\r\nâ€¢	Rachel Gooding will check her queue daily for fully approved request\r\nâ€¢	She will print out DNCR request form fully signed by employee and supervisor\r\nâ€¢	She will obtain remaining required signatures\r\nâ€¢	Once all signatures are done, she will send the request to DNCR\r\nâ€¢	When cards come back, she will update the database with required information and send the cards out to staff\r\n\r\nStaff who make purchases on behalf of the division should be knowledge of purchasing guidelines whether it is direct pays or using the p-card.  No seasonal or temp should be making purchases on behalf of the state.  \r\n\r\nLook at your staff and your work schedules to determine how many p-cards you need to cover your operations ( you can have as many as you need).  \r\n\r\nSuperintendents are allowed to get a p-card but they need to understand they canâ€™t approve their own p-card reconcilements and they will have to get their region superintendentâ€™s approval and still meet the weekly p-card reconciling deadlines. \r\n\r\nIf a Superintendent is out of the office, he should name someone who is listed in the cash handling plan to approve while he is gone.  However, that person canâ€™t approve their own charges if they have  a card  they would need to get the regional approval and still meet weekly p-card reconciling deadlines.   \r\n\r\nAll reconcilements are due to Rachel Gooding every Tuesday by close of business.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTammy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***************************************************************************\r\nTammy Dodd\r\nBudget Officer\r\nNC STATE PARKS\r\n1615 MSC\r\nRALEIGH NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone: 919-707-9359\r\nFax: 919-715-5160\r\ntammy.dodd@ncparks.gov\r\n***************************************************************************\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '2017-05-17 08:31:35', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 622),
('New DNCR Print Preview Button For Code Sheets', 'Williams', 'Email from Tammy Dodd \r\nWed 5/10/2017 12:35 PM\r\n\r\nDNCR no longer wants our current code sheets, they only want the invoice, vendor FID# Group# and funding information to come to them.    They also wanted  us to hand write all this info on the invoices but I said no because it will be too messy, wrong information can be written down and etc.  Most importantly, preparing invoices for payment is how we monitor our budgets, track projects and collect our energy usage (key once and use many different ways). \r\n\r\nFor the past 3 months, Rebecca has been cleaning up the vendor databases to delete vendors no longer used, vendors no longer showing in NCAS and correcting incorrect FID# And Group# on remaining vendors.  When she started we had 15,000 vendors in the database and now we are down to around 2,000.  \r\n\r\nAlso for the past month, DNCR would not take our code sheets any longer so Rebecca had to create labels to capture your funding information and affix the label to each invoice.  This  has been very time consuming and inefficient.  So while  she  was doing this,  Tony and Tom worked on creating a DNCR print preview button to provide the info DNCR now wants.\r\n\r\nBelow is the updated procedure for preparing invoices for payment:\r\n\r\n1.	Invoice must be date stamped as to day received to your office\r\n2.	Invoice should be prepared for payment within 5 days of receipt to your office (utilities are to be done immediately)\r\n3.	Invoice must be entered into the money counts database as normal (none of this has changed)\r\n4.	You can still duplicate if you have more than one invoice to the same vendor and same remit to address (just because same vendor does not mean same remit to you must double check the invoice)\r\n5.	When choosing your vendor, you must ensure what you pull back to the code sheet matches the remit to on the invoice (they must match)\r\n6.	For filing purposes only, you can still print out the old code sheet format but it is not to come to our office and does not have to be signed (this is the â€œpreviewâ€ button) \r\n7.	You now will select the â€œDNCR Preview buttonâ€ to print out the info to come with the invoice\r\n8.	If you have more than one invoice on a code sheet, there will be a funding page for each one.  \r\n9.	Each funding page has the amount of the invoice which is to be paid (make sure to match them to the correct invoice).  \r\n\r\nFor an example I have attached two invoices to the same vendor I prepared for payment:\r\nâ€¢	The  invoices are date stamped as to date received in our office\r\nâ€¢	Bryan Dowdy signed as to receipt of the merchandise (most times, the superintendent has this included in his approval stamp so that is ok to continue)\r\nâ€¢	I have approved it for payment \r\nâ€¢	Behind each invoice I have my funding page information which gives vendor FID# Group#, funding info, amount of invoice and comments.\r\nâ€¢	I would paperclip the correct funding page to the correct invoice and if I was in the field, I would then mail to the DPR budget office (utilities still go to the utility svc email account). \r\n\r\nSo now that old code sheet is no longer accepted and no longer has to be signed by anyone,  I  should not get many invoices from a park which are not approved.  If a superintendent is going to be out, he should name a backup manager (listing of his backups are in the cash handing plan on the money counts database) and the backup should approve the invoice for payment. Of course if the superintendent and his back up are both out for an extended period of time, I will approve invoices for you but as I said this should be a rare occurrence. \r\n\r\nI forgot to say, the funding page can be printed on white paper.  No need to be on yellow any longer.\r\n\r\nYour contract invoices are to still be done on the contract payment form (this has not changed).\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTammy\r\nTammy Dodd\r\nBudget Officer\r\nNC STATE PARKS\r\n1615 MSC\r\nRALEIGH NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone: 919-707-9359\r\nFax: 919-715-5160\r\ntammy.dodd@ncparks.gov\r\n', '', '', '', '2017-05-17 09:13:47', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 623),

See:  http://www.ncwildlife.org/Licensing/Other-Licenses-Permits/Wildlife-Possession-and-Salvage-Permit#51721453-descriptionbrbr\r\n\r\n2)  We still need to operate under a US Fish & Wildlife Permit for migratory birds.  Permit is attached. \r\n\r\n3)  For Turkey and Deer, we need permission to salvage from NC Wildlife Resource Commission.  Should a park wish to salvage Turkey or Deer, refer our park staff to their local WRC agent for advice.\r\n\r\n4)  We need written permission to salvage any threatened or endangered animal.  Park staff should contact their local WRC agent for advice should that come up.\r\n\r\n5)  If a park wishes to salvage marine mammals, bald eagle, golden eagles or federally endangered/threatened migratory birds, they would directly need to handle those permits.  State Parks Headquarters only handles the permit for non-threatened migratory birds.  \r\n\r\n6) Wildlife salvage reports will be due by December 15th.  Please keep detailed information on your wildlife salvaged, including eggs and bird nests.  The minimum information required is county, date, # collected, species, and disposition.  Disposition refers to where the salvaged animal will ultimately end up (e.g., visitor center, museum of natural sciences).  \r\n\r\n7) One of the best ways to preserve your specimens is to store them in ziplock freezer bags and place in a freezer that is opened infrequently.  It is best not to wrap them in newspaper. \r\n\r\n8) For rare or unusual specimens that may have scientific value, we are encouraged to contact the NC Museum of Natural Sciences Ornithology Lab.  The lab can usually help us obtain most species we want for taxidermy display in exchange for our scientifically valuable specimen.\r\n\r\n9) Find the updated USFW migratory bird permit on the salvage database.

We only accept them for the amount of sale only.  No cash back given.\r\n\r\nAccepting credit cards will cut down on the amount of cash and checks you have to handle. The less cash and checks you have to handle means a decrease in the amount of deposits you have to take to the bank. \r\n\r\nI need for it to be extremely clear that if you accept cash and checks within your parks, you are still required to make deposits to your local bank.  By state law, you are required to make a daily deposit if the amount of cash and checks you collect total $250 and you are required to make at least one weekly deposit regardless if you have reached the $250 threshold.  \r\n\r\nCarolina Beach, Jordan Lake and Morrow Mountain have been piloting the acceptance of credit cards and have reported no notable problems.  I am sure they would be willing to answer any questions you might have. \r\n\r\nBelow are the steps you must follow for the accepting of credit cards and the accountability of the credit card receipts:\r\n\r\n1.	Once a credit card is presented, you should verify that the person who is handing you the credit card is the actual owner of the credit card.\r\n2.	You will swipe the card through the swipe terminal.\r\n3.	Double check to ensure the number on the card is what has posted on the screen/terminal.\r\n4.	If the card is declined, politely ask the customer for another form of payment.  We are not able to inform the customer as to why it was declined.\r\n5.	Two receipts will print out.\r\n6.	The first one is for the customer to sign and is the one we keep.\r\n7.	The second is for the customer to keep as their receipt.\r\n8.	All signed receipts are to be kept with the detailed operator report, filed by the day of occurrence and to be locked in a file cabinet.  \r\n9.	You will do NO deposits for credit cards nor send me any receipt copies.  However; if I call for a particular customer receipt, you should be able to locate it for me. \r\n10.	All credit card deposits are handled by the DPR Budget Office via a Wachovia daily bank report and reports generated by Infospherix.\r\n\r\nAs you begin to accept credit cards, please advise me of any issues you may have.

This yearâ€™s conference will begin Monday, November 14th, 1pm at the Vade Mecum property of Hanging Rock State Park.  For those driving from the east, there will be a 15 passenger van leaving from HARI at 11:30am and traveling to Vade Mecum for the start of the conference.  Feel free to arrive at HARI prior to this time to carpool.  If more than 15 people meet, additional carpools will be needed.  For those coming from the west, you may find it more convenient to drive directly to Vade Mecum.  That evening, we will return to HARI for dinner and hold the remainder of the conference at HARI.  Meals at HARI will begin with dinner on Monday, November 14th.  Therefore, you need to get your lunch on the 14th at an alternate location.\r\n\r\nIf you will not be attending the entire conference, or not need all meals and overnight accommodations, please let me know so we can plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nSince today is election day, I thought it fitting to also attach a sample ballot for this yearâ€™s conference committee voting.  You will receive the ballot that is for your region and voting on one member.  You will see on the ballot that some names are in dark gray.  You cannot vote for these superintendents as they are either currently serving on the committee, or have not been a superintendent for at least two years.  You will also see that I have put dates next to some names.  These  are the people that have graciously served in planning the conferences of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Burns and Shearin Backwards Bullet Award Returns\r\nIn 2009, it was decided to halt the Backwards Bullet Award and to develop a new Park of the Year Award.

However, upon review of the Original Annual B-S Backwards Bullet Award Rules, it is clear that the proper procedures were not followed in abolishing the award, specifically, rule 8b, 8c, 8d, and 8e.  Since the protocol was obviously not followed, and the fact that our current Chief of Operations, Adrian Oâ€™Neal holds the award â€œin a prominent place in his officeâ€ according to rule #6 and is itching to pass this honor to someone else, the B-S Backwards Bullet Award will be reinstated at the 2016 Conference of Superintendents.  (see attachment for official rules and more information)  With this in mind, the last recipient of the award determines this yearâ€™s recipient.  If you have any good nominations or stories for Adrian,  you can send them directly to him.  If you want your submission to be anonymous, you may funnel it through me as I am sworn to secrecy of whence it came.\r\n\r\nWe believe there is ample space for both awards moving into the future.  As Sid Shearin said years ago, our hope is that this award is â€œgiven in good hearted fun for friends who we love as a way of saying that we understand and have all been there.â€  This is not only a way to have some fun and build comradery, but also a serious way of saying, â€œyou made it through that trial or difficulty.â€  It should be a way to encourage each other in acknowledging that we all make mistakes and that integrity, taking responsibility, and showing perseverance is what it takes to make it through.  This award truly celebrates making it through the hard times, whether those hard times were self-imposed or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached are several items providing you with information concerning the conference.

('TAG THE 1099 FIELD ON THE ACCOUNTING CODE SHEETS AND P-CARD RECONCILEMENTS FORMS FROM THIS POINT ON', 'Williams', 'WE HAVE TO TAG THE 1099 FIELD ON THE ACCOUNTING CODE SHEETS AND P-CARD RECONCILEMENTS FORMS FROM THIS POINT ON.  Per DENR Controller?s office the vendor?s FID# is not the driving factor and we must determine whether the vendor needs to be tagged with an ?M7? or an ?X?.    \r\n\r\nThe following describes what ?X? and ?M7? stands for in regards to a vendor:\r\n?	The ?X? means the vendor is Incorporated and does not require a 1099 for services rendered.\r\n?	The ?X? means we only bought goods from a vendor and it does not matter if they are incorporated or not. \r\n?	The ?M7? means the vendor is not incorporated and does require a 1099 for services rendered. \r\n?	The ?M7? means goods or services purchased from an individual who is not a company.   \r\n?	The 1099 field can?t be left blank, it must be populated with either X  or M7. \r\n?	If you are ever unsure always put an M7 to be on the safe side but just don?t choose this out of habit.  You must do your best to choose the right one.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between a service and a good?:\r\n?	A service is when a vendor makes a repair, does inspections, provides waste pickup, provides utilities and basically where the vendor provides some form of labor.\r\n?	A good is equipment, supplies or anything we purchase that we take back to the park to use in our jobs or we use in making our own repairs. \r\n\r\nHow do I know if the vendor is incorporated or not:\r\n?	They will have INC after their name or the word Corporation as part of their name\r\n?	If they don?t have INC after their name, you must call and ask\r\n?	LLC is not an incorporated company. It stands for Limited Liability Company so if this is after their name the code to choose is M7\r\n?	Search our NC Secretary of State website: http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/CSearch.aspx\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples that may help(Given By Jeannie Betts w/DENR Controller?s Office).\r\n1)	If you call Mom & Pop Plumbing Co. to repair a toilet, they will require a 1099 code since they are not incorporated and you are paying for their services.\r\n2)	If you call Mom & Pop Plumbing Co. just to buy a toilet, they will not require a 1099 code since you are buying goods.\r\n3)	If you call Office Depot, Inc. to buy your office supplies, they will not require a 1099 code since they are a corporation (Inc.).\r\n4)	If you call Hook & Crook Attorneys, LLC for legal services, they will require a 1099 code since they are not incorporated and you are paying for their services.\r\n5)	If you call  DON REUTER to buy a new printer, he will require a 1099 code since you are making a purchase from an individual.  (He would get a 1099 no matter whether you buy goods or services from him because he is an individual. An individual usually only uses his social security number as his FID#)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe database will soon be updated where you are forced to choose an X or an M7 but in the mean time, you must populate this field either by hand on the code sheet or when doing the p-card reconcilement.  You must do your best to choose the accurate one.  \r\n\r\nThanks, Tammy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*************************************************************\r\nTammy Dodd, Budget Officer\r\nNC State Parks\r\n', 'http://149.168.1.195/find/graphics/FW 1099 CODE ON ACCOUNTING CODE SHEETS AND P-CARD RECONCILEMENTFORMS .htm', '', '', '2011-04-18 14:33:05', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 316),

There is no change in policy regarding sick\r\nleave; you will continue to accrue and take sick leave the same way you always have.

The State Personnel Commission recently approved the revision, effective March 1, 2010.  You may view the policy on the DENR web site.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a summary of changes to the policy:\r\n\r\n?	Including a definition for ?competencies? as it relates to career-banded vacancies (page 7)\r\n\r\n?	Allowing hiring managers to be involved in the determination of the most qualified pool (page 8) ? previously, hiring managers were not allowed to conduct any level of applicant screening ? hiring managers will not be involved in screening for minimum qualifications\r\n\r\n?	Eliminating the use of the term ?highly-qualified,? and replacing with ?most-qualified? ? ?most qualified? is the terminology used in Statute \r\n \r\n?	Including standard language for Appeals (page 11)\r\n\r\n?	Including the Recommendation Package Checklists for both traditional and banded classes (page 12)\r\n\r\nPlease note that:\r\n\r\n?	DPR Human Resources will determine when a hiring manager gets involved in the screening for the most qualified pool.  The hiring manager is not required to determine every most qualified pool.  The decision to include the hiring manager in the screening of the most qualified pool should be based on factors such as the type of position to be filled, limited timeline for filling the vacancy,  hiring manager?s understanding of the screening process, etc.  Criteria for determining the most qualified pool should continue to be documented on the Qualification Screening Chart.

('Phone Lines - SIPS ALL DPR PHONE BILLS ON DATABASE-ACCOUNTING ', 'Williams', 'Dear All:\r\n\r\nThe sips phone bill for each park can be viewed  via the database under the Division Personnel/Park Info\r\n\r\nBefore I explain how it works here is why it is done this way now???.. The SIPS phone bill is in an archaic format from NC ITS that we must try to decipher and pay each month when it comes due.  Eva use to have to print out the info for each park and then mail/fax to them but this was only for information purposes because we don?t have time for the parks to approve the bill (if something did not look right, they were to let Eva know so she could follow back up with ITS). The printing, mailing or faxing of these SIPS phone bills to the parks could take Eva up to one to two days to complete because of the vast number of lines for each park.  Since I knew that Tom Howard is a genius, I pleaded for his help to make this easier on Eva and become a paperless system.  \r\n\r\nThe SIPS phone logs are tied to the Park/Staff  contact info in What is my Status.  Each and every DPR employee is suppose to have this info fully and correctly completed.  Work numbers should only be put in the spots designated for such and vice versa for personal numbers.  So for example, if you put your personal cell phone number in where your work cell phone should be, you will see your personal cell number on the phone list but when you click on it you get a message that this is not a billable SIPS number and to contact Eva Ennis or Tom Howard. There may be cell phones and land lines not directly connected to a staff member and this keeps them from showing up on the phone log.  Once Tom is made aware of these sips numbers he can fix them so they show up.\r\n\r\nOk now the below is how to view your monthly SIPS phone bill each month:\r\n\r\n1.	Log into the DPR database \r\n2.	Click on: Division Personnel/Park Info\r\n3.	In the middle search box Called Contact Info, scroll down until you see Phone Logs and choose it.\r\n4.	A search box called  Phone Logs shows up, scroll down to see the months available to look at, click on the one you wish to view.\r\n5.	You will now see a listing of all your phone/cell lines and that are tied to a person?s name or are generic (if they don?t show up contact Tom Howard and myself to figure out why).\r\n6.	Clicking on the number will bring up a copy of the sips charges for the month your are viewing.\r\n\r\nYou need to ensure the following is correct for each number:  16 digit Department Code which consist of 1600 at the beginning, your park center in the middle and 4 zeros at the end. For example my Department Code is 1600128027510000 (if this is not correct, let Eva know and she can get it corrected).  If cell phone, make sure you are not going over your monthly cell phone plan allowace and if so, you may need to change plans (if cell phone plans need to be changed or upgrade of equipment, please let me know and I will instruct you on the process).\r\n\r\nYou can print out your SIPS phone logs if you like, but of course since electronic, you don?t have to.  REMEMBER THE PHONE LOGS ARE ONLY FOR PHONE/CELLS LINES PAID VIA NC ITS SIPS PHONE BILL. ALSO, EACH PARK CAN ONLY SEE THEIR INFO. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps everyone to understand how the phone log came to be, what drives them to show up and how to get things corrected.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nTammy\r\n', 'http://149.168.1.195/find/graphics/Sips Phone Logs via the database.htm', '', '', '2011-02-16 09:36:54', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 303),

All updates will be done via the database. Detailed instructions are listed at the end of this memo. \r\n\r\nIt is imperative that we do this correctly so that our Fixed Asset System accurately reflects what each Division owns.  The fixed assets reports we send to the Controllerâ€™s Office is provided to the State Auditors during their annual audit of the Departmentâ€™s financial statements.  Your assistance and cooperation are essential to provide an accurate listing of all assets.\r\n\r\nNO CHANGES OF ANY KIND WILL BE ALLOWED FOR VEHICLES/TRAILERS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL FROM TAMMY DODD.\r\n\r\nNO CHANGES OF ANY KIND WILL BE ALLOWED FOR WEAPONS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL FROM BRYAN DOWDY. \r\n\r\nNewly reported missing assets require extreme justification and all efforts to find the items should be exhausted. Maybe the item in question was given to another park but proper transfer paperwork was not completed.  Our Director has to sign off on all missing assets so keep that in mind.  \r\n\r\nAll required fixed assets forms can be found at the following website address:  http://portal.ncdenr.org/web/ooc/ .  Once you have accessed this website click on Calendar and then choose â€œClick here to access the employee pagesâ€.    You will then be taken to the NCDENR Central Authentication Service page.  Sign into this page using the same username and password you use to complete your time sheet.  Once you have logged in correctly you will be able to find all the current DENR fixed assets forms. \r\n\r\nStep by step instructions are included as per below:  \r\n\r\nFIXED ASSET AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1ST PHASE: \r\n\r\n1.	Log into the database (http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php) and FIND the FAS link.\r\n2.	Find your FAS location from the drop down menu and then export your file.  You will use this as your paper inventory for making notes etc. \r\n3.	The report was run January 22nd, so if you don\'t see current FAS items listed don\'t panic.  You will not need to worry about relisting/reporting those items.  The DPR budget office could have made the determination that an item in question did not to put on fixed asset.  If you have questions, just call. \r\n4.	Verify all assets with a \"U\" which means \"IN USE\" on the report are physically at your location. \r\n5.	Verify that all serial numbers, descriptions, make models are accurate.  \r\n6.	Phase One needs to be completed by 2/22/13. \r\n\r\n\r\n2ND PHASE:\r\n\r\n1.	Log into the database (http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php) and FIND the FAS link.\r\n\r\n2.	Find your FAS location from the drop down menu. Look for the UPDATE FORM link next to the EXCEL export.\r\n\r\n3.	You will find several columns in which you can key your required changes. \r\n\r\n4.	Corrected Location (use dropdown menu): If your items are still at your park, then you leave this field blank.  If this item is no longer at your park but has been transferred to another park, choose the new corrected location from the drop down menu.  You will need to complete a Fixed Asset Change of Location Form which must be signed by both Parks.  The form must be submitted by the original owner and becomes part of their fixed asset documentation.  \r\n\r\n5.	Corrected Asset Description: If item is not described correctly, type in accurate description.  No extra form to be completed.\r\n\r\n6.	Corrected Standard Description: IF your standard description is not accurate, click on the find button in this column and look through and find best standard description.  Once you choose one, it automatically brings it back to the column.  No extra form to be completed.\r\n\r\n7.	Corrected Make: If make is not correct type in correct info in this column.  No extra form to be completed.\r\n\r\n8.	Corrected Budget Code and Corrected Center: These columns are locked down and no changes can be made.  We do not change the original payment info.  \r\n\r\n9.	Corrected Serial#: If serial number is not correct, type in corrected info in this column.  No extra form to be completed. \r\n\r\n10.	Corrected Object Code: Tammy Dodd will make all these changes. DO NOT KEY ANYTHING INTO THIS COLUMN.\r\n\r\n11.	Corrected Model: If model is not correct, type in corrected info. No extra form to be completed. \r\n\r\n12.	Corrected Status Code (use dropdown menu): \r\nA. IF your current status code is a \"U\" (in use) and still at your park, you do not put anything in this column.  \r\n\r\nB. If your current status code is \"M\' (missing) then you need to change status to \"R\" (retired) and no other forms are required to be completed because this is the second year missing and all applicable forms were completed last year.  Just put in the comments field â€œ2nd Year Missingâ€.\r\n\r\nC. If your current status code is \"S\" (surplus) this is an error and you need to get with Joanne to find out what is going on.  It may not have been delivered to State Surplus or State Surplus did not properly update the system.  If no longer at your park you must change status to \"M\" (missing) and complete a Fixed Assets Missing Form. \r\n\r\nD. IF your current status code is a \"U\" (in use) but you can no longer locate the item, then you will need to change the status to \"M\" (missing) and you will need to complete a Fixed Asset Missing Form. Keep in mind that our Director Lew Ledford has to sign off on all missing paperwork which does not make him very happy so please make every effort to find the item and if not make sure to have a good justification in the comments section column and on the Fixed Asset Missing Form.   \r\n\r\nE. If your current status code is a \"U\" (in use) but it is a piece of furniture that no longer is required to be on fixed assets, change status to \"R\" (retired) note reason in the comments column  and no other form is required.  Joanne Barbour will be looking for these items as well. \r\n\r\nF. If your current status code is a \"U\" but you can prove the items was accepted or sold at State Surplus, change status to \"Surplus\" and you must complete a Fixed Asset Retirement form and include documentation from State Surplus that supports your claim. \r\n\r\n13.	Once you have made all your changes in the system, you will send Joanne Barbour an email letting her know you are finished.  You will need to make one PDF copy of all your required fixed assets documents and attach it to the email as well.  You will not send us any hard copies of any kind. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need help, Contact Joanne Barbour at 919-707-9353\r\n\r\nThis is due back by March 8th.   \r\n', 'http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2013/DPR_FY1213_fixed_asset_memo.doc,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2013/FW_Fixed_Asset_Inventory_due_back__March_8_2013.txt', '', '', '2012-05-15 13:55:02', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 379),

This is intended to update everyone on what is going on in the world of Centennial event planning.  Please feel free to send me notes on what is happening in your park or area.  These notes will also include important dates and deadlines.\r\n\r\nOne of the great things that is happening at the same time as our centennial is the centennial of the National Park Service.  This means that our Federal Brothers and Sisters in the Grey and Green are going through the same trials and tribulations that we are with event planning.  I would encourage you to interact with the National Parks closest to you to see if there are opportunities to collaborate and build relationships.  This could lead to long term management partnerships that can be very beneficial to all involved. At the very least it would be a great time to exchange ideas.  Learn more about the NPS Centennial plans at http://www.nps.gov/2016 .\r\n\r\nThose that attended the FSP Conference this week saw the new table displays that we will be using for the upcoming centennial and beyond.  It will include a 3x5 collapsible display, a table cover, a foldable 8 foot table and a digital screen and player loaded with a short video that highlights the centennial.  During the meeting we asked the local friends to start a campaign to purchase these and make them available for each park.  We are hopeful that they can reach this goal.  They will be good for displaying in the park and they are also transportable and quick to set up so hopefully each park will get additional use when they are participating in outreach.  To compliment these displays, I would like for your staff to create a scrapbook that will capture our past and our future and will grow long past the centennial.  This project will document the changes and advances in your individual park and our park system.  Included in these should be high quality reproductions of original documents, photos and news articles that tell the story of your parks.  Recently, there has been a great deal of time spent collecting and cataloging such memorabilia from the last 100 years in preparation for the centennial.  Continuing the legacy for the next 100 years with a controlled mindful collection and archiving of its memorabilia will be important.  This effort will also be appreciated by Division staff long after we are all just â€œworn out old Park Rangersâ€ (quote from the infamous South District Superintendent Scott Daughtry).  We will have a few examples at upcoming meetings that you will be able to glean ideas from and I hope the entire staff at your park will work as a team to produce a similar product that can act as a collection point for each park. Denise will follow up with additional information regarding proper archiving of these resources in the Database.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to see each park designate a staff member to be the main contact for centennial issues.  Since I know how busy each of you are, I hope this will  present an opportunity to give one of your staff members a very important leadership opportunity as well as making a focused contact point in each park.  This will help us stay on track with planning and other issues that may arise during this centennial event.  It is important to remember that the Centennial is not a sprint, but a marathon that will last more than a year and there will be responsibilities that will span the duration. Please send the name of your contact person to your District Superintendent to be complied and sent to Denise Williams.  I would like to have this list in place by the end of February.  I know that all of you do great things every day and this Division encompasses a wide range of talents and it will take all of those talents to accomplish what is expected over the next 22 months. \r\n\r\nPlease remember that parks are never a final product and this is just the start of the next 100 years of greatness. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdrian\r\n\r\nAdrian Oâ€™Neal\r\nChief of Operations\r\nNC Division of Parks and Recreation\r\n', '', '', '', '2015-02-10 15:19:32', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 522),
('I&E Forms and Frequently Asked Questions (NORTH DISTRICT)', 'Bockhahn', 'North District I&E website FAQ and forms.  \r\n\r\nAttachments listed as numbers (#).\r\n\r\nHow do we handle program requests?\r\n\r\nThe lead I&E ranger at each park responds to program requests.  Teachers should fill out a PROGRAM REQUEST FORM (1) and submit it at least 30 days prior to requested date.  If park staff are unavailable or if the request is from outside your region, have them contact Brian.Bockhahn@ncparks.gov.  A listing of our programs are in the field trip database: http://ncparks.gov/Education/fieldtrips.php and each park will have a BROCHURE of programs that are offered.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Junior Ranger program?\r\n\r\nThe #1 thing you can promote at your programs, festivals, events and visitor centers is this stewardship program.  You can print and post a JUNIOR RANGER FLYER (2) here.  Each park should have a few copies of the booklet and park visitors can print their own copy from our WEBSITE http://ncparks.gov/Education/jrranger.php.  Each park should have a supply of patches, if you run out you can reorder through your friends group.  \r\n\r\nFor an example of North District patches see this JUNIOR RANGER PATCHES FLYER (3).  Junior ranger certificates are available as a PDF (4) or in POWER POINT (5) depending on how you want to fill in their names.  Make sure to get photos and have them sign up for the junior ranger newsletter by emailing Sean.Higgins@ncparks.gov.\r\n\r\nWhat is an annual theme?\r\n\r\nEach calendar year NC State Parks will celebrate a different wildlife or nature â€œthemeâ€.  Educators resources for the 2014 theme â€œButterflies and Mothsâ€ are available here http://ncparks.gov/Education/emergeandfly.php.  Each park should get a supply of bandanas for sale or park visitors can get them on our web store http://www.ncparkstore.com/collectiblebandana.html.  Annual theme FLYERS (6) can be posted around the park.\r\n\r\nWhat about First Day hikes and other annual events?\r\n\r\nEvery NC State Park will host annually\r\nâ€¢	A First Day hike on Jan 1 (attendance must be reported immediately after program)\r\nâ€¢	An Earth Day week event around April 22\r\nâ€¢	A TACO week program Sep 24-30\r\nAnd two of the other following options: North Carolina Science festival Mar 28-April 13; National Kids to park day May 17; National Trails Day June 7; National Great Outdoors Month June; National Public Lands Day Sep 27\r\n\r\nWhat is AIT?\r\n\r\nAdvanced Interpretive Training or AIT workshops are available to all DPR staff.  AIT approved courses are listed in our Training database: http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php.  Clicking on each class you can find out which category the AIT is, or you can also see a LIST OF AIT WORKHOPS (7) here.  To track the completion of an AIT cycle use this AIT CYCLE TRACKING FORM (8) and send it to your District I&E Brian.Bockhahn@ncparks.gov when complete.\r\n\r\nHow do I create a new exhibit?\r\n\r\nFirst step is to notify Brian.Bockhahn@ncparks.gov  what you are planning.\r\n If you have the ability to design your own you can send the proofs to Brian.Bockhahn@ncparks.gov  for review and to acquire a project number for funding.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have the ability to design your own, you can use the CONTENT DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET (9) or the shorter SIMPLE CONTENT WORKSHEET (9A) and send it along with photos to Brian.Bockhahn@ncparks.gov.  It will be entered into the Exhibits database and someone from the exhibits team will be assigned to design it.  A proof will be sent to you for review and approval before printing.\r\n\r\nIf you put the effort in to create or design a display it will get funded.\r\n\r\nFor examples of existing exhibit panels visit the Exhibit Program database: http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php.  (you may need to get permission from Tom.Howard@ncparks.gov to access this intranet site.)\r\n\r\nHow do I create a new program?\r\n\r\nPark staff can use the new DPR INTERPRETIVE PROGRAM OUTLINE (10) to create or update interpretive programs.  For a list of catchy titles see this PROGRAM TITLE FLYER (11).  To obtain checklists visit the NRID: https://auth.dpr.ncparks.gov/login_form.php?db=nrid click on checklists, then select a park and checklist group.  We are currently developing some NCDPR FACT SHEETS to aid in programming.  \r\n\r\nDonâ€™t forget to have your programs evaluated, using the general public PROGRAM EVALUATION (12) or the peer/supervisor evaluation for INTERPRETIVE TALKS (12) and for NATURE HIKES (12).  The Divisionâ€™s I&E council has also created several beneficial publications: DOâ€™S AND DONTâ€™S OF INTERPRETATION (13); STEPS IN PREPARING AN INTERPRETIVE TALK (14) ; STEPS IN PREPARING NATURE HIKES (15).\r\n\r\nHow do I advertise programs?\r\n\r\nAll programs should be entered into our calendar of events database http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php .  The lead I&E or a designee is responsible for entering programs on the COE and for reporting program numbers on the I&E website.  Program flyers can be displayed around the park on buildings, displays cases, entrance stations and visitor centers.  See PROGRAM FLYER TEMPLATES (16).   Each park should also list their programs in local papers, radio spots, local libraries, etc.  Park visitors can view our programs here http://ncparks.gov/Education/events.php.  \r\nThe NC Office of EE also maintains a calendar here http://web.eenorthcarolina.org/core/event/calendar.aspx.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Fishing Tackle Loaner Program?\r\n\r\nThe Fishing Tackler Loaner Program (FTLP) is a cooperative agreement with the NC Wildlife Resources Commission: http://www.ncwildlife.org/Fishing/LearnResources/Programs/TLP.aspx.  Once an agreement is signed parks that participate will receive a certain amount of fishing tackle to be loaned out like a library checks out books.  This is a cost share program but the cost to us is minimal.\r\n\r\nWhat do I do with volunteers?\r\n\r\nEach park should have a staff member designated as volunteer coordinator.  New volunteers can fill out form V3 the volunteer agreement form, which is part of the BASIC VOLUNTEER FORM PACKET (17).  For potential eagle scouts there is an EAGLE SCOUT PACKET (18).  All volunteers less than 16 years of age need to fill out the parental approval form if their parents are NOT on site with them.  Volunteer hours need to be reported to the parks volunteer coordinator to be entered into the volunteer database http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php.  See the volunteer guidelines for information and the volunteer awards recognition program.\r\n\r\nWhat is a salvage report?\r\n\r\nAt the end of each calendar year each park is required to submit a SALVAGE REPORT (19) of any wildlife salvaged via roadkill or natural causes.  Even if nothing is salvaged, a report must be sent annually to Brian.Bockhahn@ncparks.gov.  You can also review our Salvage guidelines.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Form B?\r\n\r\nA Form B tracks hours for the NC EE Cerfification, you can find a blank copy here http://www.eenorthcarolina.org/form_b_2012.pdf.  Each enrollee should be able to log in to see their renewal dates and status. \r\n\r\nWhat is a TRACK trail?\r\n\r\nMost NC State Parks have or are establishing a TRACK trail through the Blue Ridge Foundationâ€™s Kids in Parks program: http://www.kidsinparks.com/trails.  Kids visiting your parks TRACK trail can select one of four brochures from the display case rack, and take their own self guided hike.  After their hike they can log into the Kids in Parks website to register their hikes and start getting cool prizes.\r\n', 'http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/6_Year_of_the_Butterfly_poster.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/7_2013_AIT_WORKSHOP_MASTER_LIST.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/8_BLANK_AIT_CYCLE_TRACKING_FORM.doc,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/9_eXHIBIT_Content_DEVELOPMENT_worksheet.docx,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/9a_Simple_Content_worksheet.doc,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/10_DPR-Interpretive_Program_Outline_2013_updated.docx,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/11_CATCHY_PROGRAM_TITLES.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/12_PROGRAM_Evaluation_Forms.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/13_Dos_and_donts_of_Interp.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/14_STEPS_IN_PREPARING_Interpretive_talks.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/15_STEPS_IN_PREPARING_Nature_Hikes.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/15_STEPS_IN_PREPARING_Nature_Hikes.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/17_VOLUNTEER_FORM_PACKET.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/18_EAGLE_SCOUT_VOLUNTEER_FORM_PACKET.pdf,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/19_BLANK_SALVAGE_REPORT.xls', 'http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/databases.php', '', '2014-02-08 16:05:46', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Bockhahn', '', 477);

('New PR-63 / DCI Number Database ', 'Williams', 'Division Field Staff,\r\n\r\nWe have now implemented a new PR-63 Case Incident / DCI Database through the Divisionâ€™s database program.  We are still in the beginning stages of implementation and still have a few kinks in the procedural & search functions to work out but the system is up and running.  All parks should now use this database for all 2013 PR-63 Case Incident Reports and for obtaining â€œOCA/Case Numbersâ€ for any DCI reports entered into their parksâ€™ Police Pak / Records Management System (RMS).  We are also asking that all parks go back and re-enter any PR-63â€™s and DCI reports they have already completed for 2013 and destroy the old hard copies.  We are reviewing the new database and process during each weekâ€™s ALERT class since the primary users of the system will be rangers and superintendents, however since the field staff will beginning using it, here are the basics of the new database;\r\n\r\nGo to the Divisionâ€™s Database Site â€“ Click on PR-63 / DCI / CITE \r\n\r\nDatabase Basics\r\nâ€¢	Each ranger, superintendent, maintenance staff and office assistant should have basic level access to the new database for entering reports and searching their park or district level (DISUâ€™s) reports.\r\nâ€¢	Click on â€œCreate a New PR-63/DCIâ€ to begin a new report process / then choose your park (or the park you need to create a report for if on temporary duty, etc.)\r\nâ€¢	The â€œCase Incident Numberâ€ is auto-generated Division wide now and will be created once the mandatory information (identified in bold green text) is entered and the â€œSUBMITâ€ button is clicked. Parks will not have their own sequential numbers as the numbering system will be sequential for the entire division.\r\nâ€¢	The â€œCall-Outâ€ block should be checked if the report is to document an incident where a staff member was called out to respond before they were officially â€œon-dutyâ€ or after being â€œoff-dutyâ€ whether they responded alone, were called out to assist another ranger, etc. This will allow us some ability to track â€œcall-outsâ€ in the future.\r\nâ€¢	Most of the blocks are self-explanatory with some drop-down boxes and calendar options.\r\nâ€¢	The â€œIncident Codesâ€ have been streamlined to eliminate some excessive codes.\r\nâ€¢	The â€œLocation Codesâ€ were also streamlined and are aligned with the CITE Database location codes. Parks that see a need to add additional locations to the PR-63 Database Location Codes (e.g. Visitor Center for administrative type reports) that are not listed, should let me know.\r\nâ€¢	The â€œInvolved Personsâ€ table and the â€œDetails of Incidentâ€ block are by default hidden but can be expanded on to enter data.\r\nâ€¢	The â€œDetails of Incidentâ€ block should be used if there are some basic information that needs to be entered, however any text longer than 5-6 lines should be attached as a MS Word document.\r\nâ€¢	Once the basics are entered, the employee should click â€œSUBMITâ€ to save the initial data and create the Case Incident Number.\r\nâ€¢	After the Case Incident Number is created, the employee can continue to add attachments such as pictures, pdf files, additional Word documents, etc. \r\nâ€¢	Once all data and attachments are completely uploaded, then the employee should click on the â€œUPDATEâ€ button to save the latest material/report draft.\r\nâ€¢	Once the employee is ready to submit their final report to their supervisor, they should check the â€œReport Complete/ready for approval by Superintendentâ€ block and click the â€œSUBMITâ€ button.  The report will now be sent to the Superintendent or the District Superintendentâ€™s review queue (in case the PASU actually writes the report) for approval.  Note: The report is still eligible for edits until the next in-line supervisor approves it.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	FOR DCI REPORTS:  The officer will need to log into the Database and enter the mandatory six items in bold green to create a Incident Number.  The officer can enter additional details if desired. The officer will then use that new Incident Number as the â€œOCA/Case Numberâ€ in their Police Pak/RMS Software Program.  \r\nâ€¢	Once the Police Pak/RMS report is generated and validated, the officer shall log back into the PR-63 Database and attached the Police Pak/RMS DCI report to the original PR-63/DCI Database entry. This can be done as an attachment or a scanned pdf file.  This will allow storage of all reports on the new database.  Also, since Police Pak/RMS systems are internal to each park and the Raleigh office doesnâ€™t have electronic access to these reports, this will allow us some ability to search and track DCI reports/incidents for the whole Division electronically.\r\nPrinting\r\nâ€¢	It is recommended that Firefox, Chrome, or Safari browsers be used for this database and printing functions as some Windows / Internet Explorer browser versions seem to have trouble with the print view/printing of the reports.\r\nâ€¢	An overview printing using the â€œView/Printâ€ button on the page of the report can be done showing the basic narratives, list of attachments and thumbnails of any pictures, pdf files, etc. BUT, using the â€œFile Menu â€“ Printâ€ from the Menu Bar may work better and should show/print out thumbnails of all attachments.  To print any of the attachments or a full size picture, each of the attachments will have to be opened and printed individually.\r\n\r\nSuperintendents/District Superintendentâ€™ Review/Approval Process\r\nâ€¢	PASUâ€™s may create new PR-63â€™s/DCI Incident Numbers as well and submit them to the District for approval in the same way as above.\r\nâ€¢	Superintendents / District Superintendents have an â€œAdmin Function Reviewâ€ access list at the bottom of their home screen for reviewing & approving submitted Case Incidents/DCI Reports.  Both will have to periodically log in and check for submitted reports from their employees/parks. We decided not to create an automatic email notification alert to the supervisor when a new report arrives in a supervisorâ€™s queue.\r\nâ€¢	To review, simply click on the Incident Number and the report will open up.  \r\nâ€¢	To approve that report and submit it to the next level, enter a date in the â€œPASU/DISU Approvalâ€ block, check the â€œReport Complete/ready for approval by Superintendentâ€ block and click the â€œUPDATE/SUBMITâ€ button.\r\nâ€¢	If the PASU/DISU desires that changes be made to the report, then that should be relayed to the person who submitted the report via email/phone call.  The report can be edited by the supervisor if necessary but if the DISU desires the report to be edited by the original employee and the PASU has already approved it with a date, then the PASU will have to log-in and delete his/her approval date in order for the report to be available for edits by the employee who created the original report.\r\n\r\nSearch Functions\r\nâ€¢	We are still working on the search function / filters, but in general a park employee can search/find/review any report that was created at their park.  District Superintendents and eventually District OAâ€™s will be able to search/find/review any report created in their district.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comments\r\nâ€¢	Reports started by one employee and saved with the initial data cannot be edited or continued by the same level or a lower level of employee. However, reports started by an employee can be continued/edited by a higher level employee.\r\nâ€¢	As stated, we are still working out kinks in the database so if you have technical / procedural questions please contact me, Phil or Tom Howard. \r\nâ€¢	As we move forward, we hope to look at combining and/or linking this database with Yancyâ€™s Division Safety Database as much as possible to streamline reports/eliminate duplication.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have comments, suggestions, issues.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBryan D.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nBryan Dowdy\r\nParks Chief Ranger\r\n\r\nNC Division of Parks & Recreation\r\n(919) 707-9340 \r\n1/31/2013  Field Staff,\r\n\r\nA couple of updated items to note for the new database.\r\n\r\n1)	 When choosing a location for administrative type reports like safety meetings, fire extinguisher checks, evidence disposal, safety meetings, etc. that you usually do at the park office/visitor center, etc. please choose your PARK OFFICE/VISITOR CENTER for the LOCATION and not â€œOTHERâ€.  IF you do not have such a location for your park, send me an email and I will add that location to your drop down list.\r\n\r\n2)	We have expanded the Text Block to allow you to type in more detail and print more text thatâ€™s directly entered on the report. However, please limit it to about 10 lines of text.  If you have longer narratives or reports needing greater detail, you should still use an attached Word document.\r\n\r\n3)	At this time, Advanced Rangers or Maintenance Mechanic Supervisors do not have the approval ability for their subordinatesâ€™ reports entered on the database. Therefore, Advanced Rangers/Maintenance Supervisors may log in / review their applicable employeesâ€™ reports and provide comments verbally and/or by email to their employees before that employee checks the â€œFinal report/submit to Park Superintendent for Approvalâ€ block to send that report to the Superintendentâ€™s queue for approval. This â€œAdvanced Ranger/Maintenance Supervisorâ€ approval process should be worked out at the park level internally by the Superintendent.  \r\n\r\n4)	We will be working on some changes to the â€œDISPOSITION CODESâ€ due to over use of the â€œOTHERâ€ code so those changes will be forthcoming soon.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBryan \r\n', 'http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2013/New_PR-63__DCI_Number_Database_.htm,http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2013/PR-63_Database_Update_1-30-13.htm', '', '', '2013-01-28 12:44:31', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 411),

This form must be kept as a matter of record in your files and readily available if an auditor wishes to see it. (Form and Q&A document attached below.)\r\n\r\nPurchasing Terminology:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Small Purchase Delegation: Purchase of Open Market goods or services $5,000 and under\r\nâ€¢ Open Market: Goods or Services not available from Correction Enterprises or on any NC State Term Contract\r\nâ€¢ Direct Payment: Purchase of an Open Market good or service and the resulting invoice is prepared for payment via an accounting code sheet\r\nâ€¢ Procurement Card (Pcard): A credit card issued to an individual in a division which enables the user to purchase goods and services without the issuance of a purchase order and without using the direct payment process \r\nâ€¢ NC State Term Contracts: Goods and Services bid out by Dept of Administration/Purchase & Contract and made available for all state agencies to order from using NC E-Procurement or Procurement Card if allowable\r\n\r\nMajor Items to Consider:\r\nâ€¢ You can only order up to $500 from state term contracts and pay with your p-card. Anything over $500 will have to have a purchase request put into E-Procurement for a purchase order to be issued.\r\nâ€¢ There are but a handful of state term contracts you can call the vendor and place an order with a p-card so be mindful of that. All this info is in the DPR Quick Reference Guide below. \r\nâ€¢ Non-Contract/Open Market purchases $2500 and under do not require any proof of best pricing source but you should always try to find best price.\r\nâ€¢ Non-Contract/Open Market purchases $2501 to $5000 requires proof of best pricing source and this information must be attached with the accounting code sheet/invoice when submitted for payment. Form is attached below,\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\n---Friends groups cannot be vendors to State Parks. They are to support State Parks and not the other way around. There could be some exceptions which must be approved in advance via email by either Adrian Oâ€™Neal or Don Reuter. Tammy Dodd must be made aware and the approval email will have to become part of the p-card receipt or direct invoice paperwork. \r\n---No seasonal employee/intern should be allowed to make purchases on behalf of the state. If they need items to do their job, they should look to their supervisors to make the purchases. If they are out on the road and need something that they absolutely have to have, then they must first have verbal approval from a supervisor. If main supervisor is not in, then they need to know who else to call to get permission.  When a employee buys something they need for their job with personal funds, they are not exempt from paying NC Sales Tax. When the employee seeks reimbursement, he gets the full amount back plus the tax. This ends up costing the division more in the end because if the purchase was made according to state purchasing guidelines, we would not pay taxes.  Please keep the above in mind and plan according for seasonal/intern needs so they will not have to make out of pocket cash purchases unless absolutely emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe attached documents include:\r\n\r\n- DPR Purchasing Quick Reference - several pages of information intended as a job aid to quickly determine if/how something should be purchased. \r\n- Purchasing Policy and Procedures Manual - this manual contains general purchasing guidelines as well as a copy of the NCDNCR Tax Exemption form.\r\n- Procurement Card Policy and Procedures Manual - this manual includes guidelines on what can be purchased and what cannot be purchased and any other limitations for pcards. It also includes the Employee Procurement Card Agreement and Tax Exemption form for NCDNCR as well as Statement of Disputed Item form and instructions.\r\n- Best Price Form:  Complete and send with invoices (direct pays) where the amount charged is over $2500. \r\n- Certificate of Exemption Form - for easy printing if needed; this document shows the Federal Tax Id #(FEIN) for NCDNCR.\r\n- Employee Procurement Card Agreement for Pcard - for easy printing if needed. Name of employee must be typed and it must be the Beacon Payroll name and no nicknames. There is a spot to insert park name or section. The rest of the form requires employeeâ€™s initials and then full signature of employee and supervisor at the bottom. Once completed, scan and email to Tammy Dodd.  In the body of the email, include a justification from the superintendent explaining why this person needs a regular p-card or a CI p-card (only one CI p-card per park unless you are in a reservoir). \r\n\r\nTAGS (budget, accounting)\r\n', 'http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2013/CI_PROCUREMENT_FROM_JERRY_H.pdf', '', '', '2013-05-20 07:46:22', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '162, 435', 0, 'Williams', '', 435),

The only time it is acceptable to use the p-card for the purchase of fuel is if the WEX card is not accepted or happens to not work and if it does not work you need to report it to me so I can find out why and get a replacement card if necessary.    \r\n\r\nIf you are ever in the situation in where the WEX card is not working or not accepted, it is ok for you to use your the p-card to get fuel to get you back on your way.  You must write the explanation of what happened on the actual receipt.   \r\n\r\n I also want to remind you that it is not necessarily any cheaper to use the DOT Filling Stations due to they add on administrative fees to the overall cost.  I think the last time I did an analysis, it was only 10 cents cheaper overall at DOT stations which if they are far from your park is not much of a cost savings.

These cards cannot be used for CI projects.\r\n- A \"CI\" p-card can only be used for CI projects (also known as Capital Improvement, CP, Major Maintenance, PARTF). Only one \"CI\" card is allowed per park unless park is a reservoir. \r\n\r\nP-card purchases are reconciled weekly (on Tuesdays, by 5 pm) in the MoneyCounts database. P-card purchases are also reconciled to a monthly bank statement each month. Procedures for reconciling weekly are attached below.\r\n\r\n-----Accessing PCard Monthly Bank Statements-----\r\n\r\nAll P-Card Users will need to register for access to the Payment Center to view and print online statements.\r\nYou can now log into the system and self-register by going to http://www.baml.com/paymentcenter and choosing the \"Not registered?\" Link. \r\n\r\nYour account# is your CC#. Follow all prompts for needed info.  You will get to an option button and you need to choose â€œonly email statementâ€ in regards to notification of monthly statement delivery (do not chose mail because it does not go to your physical address). \r\n\r\nIf you have further questions or concerns, please contact the Technical Helpdesk during business hours at 888.589.3473 or email them at commcardthd@bankofamerica.com\r\n\r\n-----P-Card Billing Information-----\r\n\r\n109 EAST JONES STREET\r\nRALEIGH NC 27601\r\nPhone# 919-807-7269\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n-----Requesting a P-Card:  Park Superintendents may request a p-card for staff that will require it for purchases. The card agreement form and instructions can be found in FIND #435 - Purchasing Guidelines as \"DNCR Employee Agreement for Pcard.\" \r\n\r\n-----Lost/Stolen Card and/or Fraudulent Activity:  See attached email from Tammy Dodd concerning lost or stolen p-cards as well as fraudulent activity/charges. The Email includes who to contact as well as forms for reporting these items. \r\n\r\n-----Transfer of Staff to Other Parks:  When staff with existing p-cards transfer to other parks and before they begin to make purchases for their new park, they need to advise Tammy Dodd of their transfer. She will manage the change with DNCR for the employee within NCAS so that they charges show up under the correct park.\r\n\r\nâ€œP-Cards may be used for Safety-Toe Boot and Wildland Fire Boots per those individual Policies found in the FIND Databaseâ€.\r\n', 'http://www.dpr.ncparks.gov/find/graphics/2014/RE_Reporting_of_LostStolen_P-Cards_or_Fraudulent_ActivityCharges.msg', '', '', '2014-09-11 08:03:59', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '598,470,506,498,536,571', 0, 'Williams', '', 498),

I know many of you have called or sent messages to say that you are giddy as a schoolgirl on prom night in anticipation of the fun, frivolity, and camaraderie that will be had on November 18 through 20 at the Summit Environmental Education Center at Haw River State Park.  \r\nSEE ATTACHMENT CONFERENCE OF SUPERINTENDENTS DISNEY SCENE PDF ATTACHMENT \r\n\r\nThe theme of this year\'s conference is \"Honoring the Past, Preparing for the Future\"; and the expectation is for you to participate fully and to \"mix it up, boys and girls, mix it up!\"\r\n\r\nThis year we will be bringing back a couple of old traditions and hopefully starting a few new traditions.  One old tradition that we will be honoring will be a field trip!!!! On Tuesday at 3:00, we will load up on a luxury motor coach and a 16 passenger van and travel to Mayo River State Park for an overview of that park\'s operations and plans for future development.  Weather permitting, the conference photograph will be made at MARI.   Clothing for the photograph and the conference is mufti, no need to wear your uniform. Following our tour of MARI, we will have supper under the big, historic picnic shelter that is the center of the park\'s current attractions.  Though we will have a roaring fire in the fireplace, and hot vittles for our bellies, the meal will be outside; so please dress warmly (average high temperature in Mayodan on November 18 is 61 degrees, average low temperature is 40 degrees).  We will be having Do It Yourself S\'mores for desert, but I have been unsuccessful at finding entertainers within our budget (basically zero dollars)to regale us with story or song while we toast our marshmallows.  So, if you play guitar, zither, or juice harp, please bring your instrument and share your talent with your peers.  If you are musically challenged, be prepared to share a joke or story while we are preparing food over the coals of a hardwood fire.  \r\n\r\nAs the conference is starting on Tuesday, you may check in to your room as you arrive at the Summit  Conference Center at Haw River State Park.  Rooms will be scarce again this year, so please know who your roommate will be and let the staff know of your roommate preference as you arrive.  (And you cannot chose Kelley King or Keith Martin as your roommate!!!!)   If you are a Park Superintendent or a District Superintendent and are not participating in the conference this year, or your participation will be limited, please let me know ASAP.  In the absence of the Park Superintendent, a representative of the park or recreation area can attend the conference in their stead; however the By-Laws only allow Park Superintendents or Acting Superintendents to vote during the business meeting.\r\n\r\nLunch will be available before the conference on Tuesday and after the conference ends on Thursday.  If you will not be eating lunch at HARI on Tuesday, please drop me a line so that the HARI staff does not prepare too much food.\r\n  \r\nIf you would like to have words of encouragement or a note of condolence sent to a Division employee or someone connected to the parks, please provide their name and address to Sue McBean at susan.mcbean@ncparks.gov .  \r\n\r\nShow your park pride by entering photos of your park and its denizens in the State Park Photo contest.  Last year\'s first place entries will be displayed in this year\'s Conference Agenda!  Dave Cook has already published the rules, and I have attached his email to this mailing.  \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, November 19 and Thursday, November 20, renowned fitness mavens Kelley King and Angelia Allcox will be hosting 30 minute fitness walks at 7:00 am.  Be sure to bring your walking shoes and be ready to \"work that body!!\" \r\n\r\nThe Awards Banquet Dinner is Wednesday night.  The festivities will begin with Appetizers and Cocktails in the Rhododendron Room at 6:00 pm.  Participants will then move into the Summit Dining Room at 6:30 pm for the main meal.  Following out repast, Anthropologist and Explorer Monroe Fisher will share with us some of his insights and experiences in over 30 years of globetrotting, and will speak about his upcoming Carolina Rivers project.  Cocktails of an adult variety will be BYOB and will be allowed in the Rhododendron Room.  Alcohol is not permitted in the Summit Dining Room\r\n\r\nIf anyone who is partaking of meals with us has special dietary needs please let me know immediately.\r\n\r\nCarl Jeeter has asked that you bring any surplus IT equipment from your park with you to the Superintendent\'s Conference.  Carl and the IT team will move the equipment to Raleigh and ensure that all information is removed from the hard drives prior to those items being surplused.  Carl will accept computer towers, monitors, scanners, printers, keyboards, laptops, etc.  Please do not bring copiers or other large items.  Carl asks that you label the front of each item with masking tape and in BOLD letter print the park\'s acronym, item FAS #, and the word \"SURPLUS\".  In addition, he would like peripheral items such as monitors and printers to be labeled as either \"working\" or \"broken\".  \r\n\r\nSNACK ALERT:  Snacks will be somewhat curtailed this year, but will be of high quality: danish at the AM break and warm cookies at the PM break, fruit, and perhaps some surprises.  Water, tea, and coffee will be available in the Rhododendron Room during the daytime hours of the conference.   Please bring your own coffee mug, Uncle Si tea glass, or sippy cup to contain your favorite daytime beverage.  As you can see, sodas and soft drinks do not appear in the provided beverage list.  Should you desire carbonated soft drinks, you will have to supply your own.   I will be bringing my own Diet Coke to caffeinate myself throughout the meeting.  \r\n\r\nWith Esteem;\r\n\r\n\r\nGreg \"The Chair\" Schneider\r\nPark Superintendent\r\nMorrow Mountain State Park\r\n\r\n704-982-4402\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************************************************************************************************************\r\n11/9/2014 email\r\nGreg, here is a copy of the certificate printed on ivory parchment to be signed by the Director and handed to the conference participants in a green and silver folder for photo op with Charlie with each set of years; 5,10,15,20,25,30.

I would like to share a couple of the questions that I have received and provide you with some of the responses as well as the policy regarding temporary employment.\r\n\r\n1.	Is this agreement to include the entire term of seasonal employment, or is this document just until the end of the fiscal year?\r\na.	These agreements will be for the entire term of seasonal employment not just the fiscal year.  So, when they are separated and return after the 31-day break or a new assignment/transfer a new agreement is to be executed.\r\n\r\n2.	I donâ€™t recall any restrictions being given out as to seasonal positions not lasting longer than six months.\r\na.	We have included into the agreement an exception process which requires the CHOP and my approval.  So, your normal practice of hiring for a period of temporary employment longer than 6 months, will not be hindered, and based on the business need.  There is however,  the one additional step for the approval.\r\n\r\n3.	I understand DPR may terminate this agreement at any time without cause and with no notice. I just want to make sure we can terminate a temporary employee at any time without cause. Or am I reading this agreement incorrectly? \r\na.	Currently, this is the process and this agreement just spells it out.  We do not have to go through the same due process as we do permanent employees. Temporary employees do not have the same rights.  \r\n\r\n4.	 Also should the 12 month agreement  be an 11 month agreement? \r\na.	The 12 month agreement is the same terminology as in the policy. You can work 11 consecutive, you cannot work a consecutive 12 months according to the policy. \r\n\r\n5.	I also need clarification on the following statement: â€œI understand I am separated from employment with DPR at the end of this period unless I qualify for an exemption (student or retiree) and my written request for exemption is approved in writing by both the Chief of Operations and DPR Human Resource Manager.â€ What exactly are these exemptions and where I can find the reference.  \r\na.	This information is covered in the policy and I have attached the Word version and the link to the policy for your reference.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your feedback.  Please let me know if there are additional areas of concerns.\r\n\r\nBeverly Blue, Human Resources\r\nDENR - Parks & Recreation Divsion\r\nNature Research Center\r\n1615 Mail Service Center, Raleigh NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone& Fax:  919-707-9360 \r\nEmail:  beverly.blue@ncparks.gov (Please note new location & email address)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPOINTMENT TYPES AND CAREER STATUS-STATE HUMAN RESOURCES MANUAL-EMPLOYMENT AND RECORDS, SECTION 3, PAGE 1, REVISED NOVEMBER 1, 2014 (FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED OR REEMPLOYED ON OR AFTER AUGUST 21, 2013)\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n		Purpose\r\n		Definition of Appointment\r\n		Probationary Appointment\r\n		Responsibility of Supervisory During Probationary Period\r\n		Appointments Providing Probationary Period Credit\r\n		Personnel Changes Not Subject to Probationary Period\r\n		Probationary Period Requirement for Reduction in Force Reemployment\r\n		Local Government Transfer Provision\r\n		Trainee Appointment\r\n		Responsibility of Supervisor during Trainee Period\r\n		Permanent Appointment\r\n		Time-Limited Appointment\r\n		Temporary Appointment\r\n		Career-State Employee Defined\r\n		Separation Prior to Achieving Career Status\r\n		Eligibility for Employee Benefits Based on Appointment Type\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\nThe purpose of this policy is to define employment requirements and summarize eligibility for benefits for the different types of employee appointments and define career State employee status. \r\n\r\nDefinition of Appointment\r\nAn appointment is the approval or certification of an applicant or employee to perform the duties and responsibilities of an established position subject to the provisions of the State Human Resources Act. The selection and appointment of all personnel into classified state service shall be made by the head of the agency subject to final approval of the State Human Resources Director. The following are the types of employee appointments:\r\nâ€¢	Probationary\r\nâ€¢	Trainee\r\nâ€¢	Permanent\r\nâ€¢	Time-Limited\r\nâ€¢	Temporary\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n \r\nProbationary Appointment\r\nIndividuals receiving initial appointments to permanent positions must serve a probationary period. The probationary period is an extension of the selection process, and provides the time the new employee needs to achieve performance at or above the expectations of the job or to be separated if performance does not meet acceptable standards.  \r\n\r\nIndividuals who are reemploying to a permanent position after a separation shall also serve a probationary period.\r\n\r\nThe probationary period shall be 24 months of either full-time or part-time employment from the actual date of employment or reemployment. Periods of extended leave of absence with or without pay do not suspend or increase the duration of the probationary period beyond 24 months. Extended leave is defined as leave in excess of one-half of the regularly scheduled workdays and holidays in the month.  The probationary period in this policy is not the same as the probationary period prescribed for criminal justice officers.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Supervisor during Probationary Period\r\nThe conditions of the probationary appointment shall be clearly conveyed to the applicant prior to appointment.  During the probationary period, the supervisor shall work closely with the employee in counseling and assisting the employee to achieve satisfactory performance.   The supervisor shall establish a work plan for the probationary employee and shall review the probationary employeeâ€™s performance in compliance with the timeframes outlined in the Performance Management Policy located in Section 10 of the State Human Resources Manual.  At the end of the probationary period when the supervisor, in consultation with other appropriate administrators, determines that the employeeâ€™s performance indicates capability to perform satisfactorily and merits retention in the position, the employee shall be given a permanent appointment to the class.  If instead, the supervisor determines that the employeeâ€™s performance indicates that the employee is not suited for the position and does not meet acceptable performance standards, or for other causes related to performance of duties or personal conduct detrimental to the agency, the employee shall be separated from that position.  The supervisor has the discretion to separate any employee not meeting acceptable performance standards or for other causes related to performance of duties or for personal conduct detrimental to the agency, prior to the completion of the 24 month probationary period.  In this case, the supervisor should document the justification for the separation based on the previously documented performance discussions.  \r\n\r\nAppointments Providing Probationary Period Credit\r\nSatisfactory service during a probationary or trainee appointment may constitute part or all of the probationary period.  \r\n\r\nPersonnel Changes not subject to a Probationary Period\r\nA probationary period shall not be required when an employee with a permanent appointment has any of the following changes:\r\n*	Promotion,\r\n*	Transfer,\r\n*	Demotion,\r\n*	Reinstatement after leave of absence, or\r\n*	Return of a policy-making/confidential exempt employee to a non-policy-making position.\r\n\r\nProbationary Period Requirement for Reduction-In-Force Reemployment\r\nAn employee with reduction-in-force priority consideration will be required to serve a new probationary period if the employee returns to work after a 31 day break in service.  The employee must work another 24 month probationary period before career status is attained.   \r\nLocal Government Transfer Provisions\r\nEmployees transferring from a local government entity subject to the State Human Resources Act and who have already attained career status are not required to serve another probationary period.  Employees who have a break in service (more than 31 days) between employment with the local government entity subject to the State Human Resources Act and the receiving state agency will be required to work a new probationary period of 24 months before career status is attained.  Employees transferring from a local government entity that is exempt from the State Human Resources Act shall be required to work a 24 month probationary period before career status is attained.\r\n\r\nTrainee Appointment\r\nA trainee appointment may be made to a permanent position when (1) the job specification includes special provisions for a trainee progression leading to regular appointment, (2) recruitment efforts fail to attract qualified candidates, (3) operating need warrants a trainee, or (4) the recommended applicant fails to meet minimum State education and experience requirements. The trainee appointment, like the probationary period, is also an extension of the selection process, and provides the time for effective adjustment of the new employee or elimination of those whose performance will not meet acceptable standards.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the trainee appointment approximates the normal time for training.  The salary progression rates are spread over the training period and provide competitive salary rates for trainees and for experienced, qualified employees.  The recruitment standards and salary progression together provide a uniform guide for equitable employment and compensation of trainees.\r\n\r\nThe duration of a trainee appointment is outlined in the Trainee Salary Schedule (Appendix A of the Salary Plan) or in the class specification for the regular classification.  When the classification does not list a trainee level, the Office of State Human Resources may approve a progression based on training and/or experience needed.  The duration of the trainee appointment is established at that time.\r\n\r\nEmployees with a trainee appointment shall work 24 continuous months to attain career status.  An employee with a trainee appointment shall achieve career status but remain in a trainee appointment if the length of the trainee progression is greater than 24 months.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Supervisor during Trainee Period\r\nThe conditions of the trainee appointment shall be clearly conveyed to the applicant prior to appointment. During the trainee period, the supervisor has a responsibility to work in assisting the employee to make satisfactory progress.  The supervisor shall establish a work plan for the trainee employee and review the trainee employeeâ€™s performance in compliance with the timeframes outlined in the Performance Management Policy located in Section 10 of the State Human Resources Manual.  When the employee has fulfilled all the trainee requirements, the appointment shall be made permanent.  If instead, the determination is that the employeeâ€™s performance indicates that the employee is not suited for the position and cannot be expected to meet acceptable standards, it is expected that the employee will be separated.\r\n\r\nPermanent Appointment\r\nA permanent appointment is an appointment to a permanently established position when the incumbent is expected to be retained in the position on a permanent basis. A permanent appointment shall be given when (1) the requirements of the probationary period have been satisfied, or (2) an employee in a trainee appointment has completed all training and experience requirements and completed 24 months of continuous employment in a position subject to the State Human Resources. or (3) a time-limited appointment extends beyond three years of continuous employment.\r\n\r\nIndividuals receiving initial appointments or reemploying after a break in service in state government must first serve a probationary or trainee appointment before being eligible for a permanent appointment.\r\n\r\nTime-Limited Appointment\r\nA time-limited appointment is an appointment that has a limited duration to:\r\n*	a permanent position that is vacant due to the incumbentâ€™s leave of absence and when the replacement employeeâ€™s services will be needed for a period of one year or less,\r\n*	a time-limited position.  If an employee is retained in a time-limited position beyond three years, the employee shall be designated as having a permanent appointment.\r\n\r\nTemporary Appointment\r\nA temporary appointment is an appointment for a limited term, normally not to exceed three to six months, to a permanent or temporary position. Upon request, the Office of State Human Resources shall approve a longer period of time; but in no case shall the temporary employment period exceed 12 consecutive months.  Exception for students and retired employees:  Students are exempt from the 12-month maximum limit.

There have been a few instances where cars are parked in these spaces reserved for someone else, and we want to avoid any confusion or inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAdrienne Eikinas\r\nExecutive Assistant\r\nNC Division of Parks and Recreation\r\nwww.ncparks.gov\r\n919-707-9336\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Dodd, Tammy \r\nSent: Friday, September 07, 2012 12:42 PM\r\nTo: Ledford, Lewis\r\nCc: Eikinas, Adrienne; Gooding, Rachel; Reuter, Don; Lambert, Mike; Howard, Tom; Howerton, Jerry\r\nSubject: 3 Departmental Spaces via Mclaurin Parking\r\n\r\nWe have just acquired 3 department spaces thanks to Pam Witt w/DPS.  They are managed on behalf of the Edenton Street Church by Mclaurin Parking.  \r\n\r\nWe can park in them Monday through Friday normal business hours which has been agreed can be from 5 am in the morning until 8 pm at night.  There can absolutely be no overnight parking or weekend parking.  \r\n\r\nI have elected to pay for the spaces on a yearly basis.  Which is cheaper than staff having to pay $16 for the day every time they have to come to a meeting.  \r\n\r\nI am hoping we can talk Tom Howard into creating a reservation system on the database so we can all look to see if anyone is parking in them and to be able to log out the spaces.  I think this will be the best approach so no one person is stuck with the responsibility.  \r\n\r\nThe spaces are 65,66 and 75.   The lot is on the corner of Edenton and Dawson.  At the light at Edenton and Dawson, go straight across and the entrance is immediately on the right.  Another frame of reference is across from the DENR Green Square Building on Dawson Street and you can turn into the lot off Dawson as well.  There is also access to the lot from Jones Street.   You can walk across the street and then walk through the paved foot path behind the DENR Green Square Building.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTammy\r\n******************************************\r\nPlease be advised my phone and fax numbers have changed:\r\nTammy Dodd, Budget Officer\r\nNC State Parks\r\n\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '2015-05-04 07:39:29', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 538),
('Outdoor Movies', 'Higgins', 'Outdoor Movies in Parks â€“ Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\nQuestion:  Do we need to purchase a public performance license to show outdoor movies for our visitors?\r\nAnswer:  Most likely yes. \r\n\r\nQuestion:  Where do we purchase these? \r\nAnswer:  There are several companies offering public performance licenses, including Swank, Criterion, MPLC.\r\n\r\nQuestion:  How much will it cost us?\r\nAnswer:  It could run anywhere from $150 to over $1000.  But about $350-$400 is a good guess for a showing that might draw in 250 visitors.  There are lots of creative ways to cover this cost.  Local business sponsorships could cover much of this cost through pre-movie screen time and logos on flyers.  \r\n\r\nQuestion:  Couldnâ€™t the division just purchase a license for all the parks?  \r\nAnswer:  No.  Weâ€™ve looked into it several times.  The rates tend to be per viewing and for an individual location.  Purchasing a â€œblanketâ€ license for all parks would be totally cost prohibitive and unusual.\r\n\r\nQuestion:  What are the exceptions that might allow us to show an outdoor movie without purchasing a public performance license?\r\nAnswer:  Copyright law includes the following exception, â€œ(1) performance or display of a work by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational institution, in a classroom or similar place devoted to instruction.â€  \r\nLetâ€™s break that exception down into three steps.\r\n1)	There would certainly have to be a significant face-to-face teaching component when showing any film to park visitors.  â€œIâ€™m naturalist Sean, welcome to the park, itâ€™s 3,000 gorgeous acres, enjoy the outdoor movieâ€, is definitely copyright infringement.\r\n2)	 The reference to a classroom or similar place devoted to instruction would not include a swim beach or a large open field. A classroom, an auditorium and an amphitheater are places devoted to instruction.  While we occasionally offer things like astronomy programs in large open fields, it would be hard to argue in court.\r\n3)	The term â€œnonprofit educational institution is a grey area of the rule, as it is not defined.  We certainly think of ourselves as nonprofit and educational, especially given our mission statement. Still, this appears to be legally untested waters.  So we definitely need to be good on steps 1 and 2 above if we choose to show an outdoor movie without a public performance license.\r\n', '', '', '', '2015-07-16 12:51:30', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Higgins', '', 540),

I have began informing the certain parks it applies to but just wanted to give everyone and overall explanation of the form. \r\n\r\n 1. Monthly service invoices which require purchase orders to be in place to allow payment of invoices will now be submitted on the contract expenditure report form 2481 (replaces the accounting code sheet). Some examples are waste pickup, port-john rentals, maintenance agreements, pest services, water testing etc. \r\n 2. This new procedure is being done because you and I must verify that you have enough funds in the purchase order before submitting for payment. \r\n 3. You still submit for payment on the new form along with the invoice to my office as normal (you never send anything directly to the Controller?s Office)\r\n 4. You will always change the Reporting Period (month services are for), Invoice#, and total which is the invoice amount you are paying. \r\n 5. You will do a new form each time you submit an invoice for payment. \r\n 6. Administrator Signature is normally the Superintendent or whoever he has assigned and I sign the other two places. If there is a different scenario, I will let you know once you are notified that the purchase order is in place. \r\n 7. You will notice at the bottom of the form there is a section call Contract Recap. This is where you keep up with how much money is left on purchase order. Beginning balance is always the full amount of the purchase order line you are working with. YTD is the payments made though out the life of the purchase order line which may sometimes cross fiscal years (YTD does not include the current invoice you are submitting for payment since it has not been paid yet). Ending Balance is automatically calculated once the first two amounts are keyed. \r\n 8. If the invoice you are going to submit is more than the ending balance, the invoice can?t be paid until purchase order is fixed and you are to contact me immediately. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions. \r\nThanks,\r\nTammy\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '2015-12-08 08:27:43', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 557),

The cost of recycling the oil is becoming greater than the recycled oil value.   At this moment, Noble Oil is continuing to provide service per the Surplus contract and hopefully that will not change.\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this note because the Surplus contract with Noble covers more than recycled oil.  At no additional cost, Noble has provided other services for your garages, such as picking up shop rags, absorbent, antifreeze and used filters. \r\n\r\nIf the oil recycling service changes from generating revenue to an expense, the Surplus contract will cease to exist.  State Surplus does not have a mechanism to contract for services that are an expense to the state.  That responsibility belongs to DOA Purchasing and Contracting.  They would have to generate a statewide contract, and bid out for an oil recycling service.\r\n\r\nThis fall, we notified P&C of this possibility in an effort to prevent a gap in services.  While P&C understood the potential problem, no action has been taken.  \r\n\r\nWe promise to keep you updated with any news effecting oil recycling.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRobert Riddle\r\n \r\nThank you\r\n\r\nKaren H Routh\r\nAssistant Property Officer\r\nState Surplus Property Agency\r\nDepartment of Administration\r\n919-854-2240   office\r\nKaren.routh@doa.nc.gov\r\n\r\n1310 Mail Service Center\r\nRaleigh, NC 27699-1310', '', '', '', '2016-01-13 07:33:43', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 566),
('Surplus Guidelines', 'Williams', 'The email texts below from Heide Rumble cover information for surplus requests. Please review procedures in attachments below for specific types of surplus items.\r\n\r\nEmail #1 - \r\nSubject: Surplus Procedures and Forms (dated 4/5/2016)\r\n\r\nGood afternoon everyone!\r\n\r\nI have expanded some of the guidelines that we reviewed in the budget training in March to include the actual vendor contracts and SSPâ€™s instructions/guidelines.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me directly if you have any questions, and Iâ€™ll be happy to help you find answers to them.  Also note that I am still working on the lost and found policy, which was sent to our lawyer yesterday.  As soon as we have a green-light, I will send it out officially.\r\n\r\nI have included the State Surplus Help link where I am able to get the contracts from on the â€œOil, Batteries, Paint and Tiresâ€ document, since thatâ€™s where you can find the contracts pertaining to those items.  But I have also put the contracts (as they are today) into the actual PDF documents themselves.\r\n\r\nOther questions asked during training were:\r\nâ€¢ Minimum on Oil pickup?  - yes, 100 Gallons of oil, and all other items in the contract are free with that pickup.  Oil will be pumped from your drums, the drums themselves will not be taken.\r\nâ€¢ Batteries: do we have to use this contract if we return the battery at the store to waive our core charge?  - no.  continue to return them to the store.  This is for parks that have mechanics and order their batteries in bulk of 5 or more at a time.\r\nâ€¢ Note that Park debris does not qualify for a landfill/scrap request, unless the item is of value (metal).  Logs, posts, and trash can be taken by your waste vendor.  If you have massive amounts of debris (like after a large storm) and it will not fit in your dumpster, you can contact Joanne Hunt and ask to have a special pickup or additional dumpster if needed.\r\nâ€¢ Aluminum and steel cans left at the park can either be part of your streamlined recycling program (due to quantity), or you can request them to be scrap metal.  The difference is that we pay money for the streamlined (or separated) recycle service as part of your trash contract (and they come and get it), and we get money for the scrap request (but you have to take it).  So, use your judgement for whatâ€™s right for your park.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you have any questions â€“ please let me know.\r\n\r\nHeide Rumble, Accounting Clerk\r\nNC State Parks\r\n1615 MSC, Raleigh NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone: 919-707-9315\r\nFax: 919-715-5160\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail #2:\r\nSubject: New Scrap and Landfill Surplus Request Guidelines (dated 1/7/2016)\r\n\r\nGood afternoon everyone!\r\n\r\nWe have new procedures that we need to put into place for requesting scrap/landfill requests.  \r\n\r\nThere is a new contracted vendor for scrap which youâ€™ll need to take your items to.  The state is now broken into 14 regions .  Iâ€™ve attached a map as well as the list of vendors.  In addition to the tracking spreadsheet (thatâ€™s also listed below).\r\n\r\nAlso, the vendors will no longer cut a check to SSP and hand it to you when you drop off your items.  Instead, they will issue you a receipt.\r\n\r\nFor each item youâ€™re wishing to take to the landfill or the recycler (for scrap metal), I need you to do the following:\r\nâ€¢ I need an email with the title saying â€œSURPLUS:SCRAP:INSERT PARK NAMEâ€\r\nâ€¢ Fill out the spreadsheet thatâ€™s attached, save it, and attach a copy to your email.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fields which are missing, it will delay your request.  Make sure if the information isnâ€™t available (if it has no asset number) you write N/A.\r\n\r\nOnce I receive the request, I will notify you of the status via email.  When I give you the go-ahead, you will have 30 days to take the items to the landfill/recycle listed.  After the 30day period has expired, surplus requires a new approval.  So, make sure youâ€™re ready to take the items when you submit the request.\r\n\r\nIf taking the items to the recycle (scrap metal in particular), all fees that you receive from the scrap metal recycler will need to be paid via check to â€œSTATE SURPLUSâ€ and not to the park directly.  You will need to send the check receipt to me via scan/email along with the original request spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nCONTRACT BINS:\r\nPlease note that in the last email I sent you about scrap metal, it was mentioned that you can have a bin from the recycler put on your site if you had enough volume.\r\n\r\nAs this is only for scrap metal, and not landfill items, it doesnâ€™t make sense for us to have these bins on-site.  So, unless you have a massive clean-up of scrap metal, we are going to not use the on-site-bins at this time.\r\n\r\nRemember, these bins were only for scrap metal, and we would still have to get approval for everything that would go into the bin before the recycler could haul it off.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need further guidance, please feel free to ask!\r\n\r\nHeide Rumble, Accounting Clerk\r\nNC State Parks\r\n1615 MSC, Raleigh NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone: 919-707-9315\r\nFax: 919-715-5160\r\nheide.rumble@ncparks.gov\r\n\r\nEmail #3:\r\nSubject:  Old cellphones when receiving an upgrade are to be suplused (dated 8/30/16)\r\n\r\nOld cellphones (when receiving and upgrade) are to be surplused!!!\r\n\r\nPlease remember that when you upgrade a cellphone that belongs to the park, you must turn the old cellphone and all of its charging equipment and battery in to Carl Jeeter and the IT team for surplus.

This can be done by calling 919-733-6540.  It is by appointment only now.\r\n- For those outside of the Raleigh area, you will need to call ARI to set up an authorization and get a PO number to take to your local service place (Jiffy Lube, Sears, etcâ€¦).  You must call them before you are in the service place.  ARIâ€™s number is part of the packet that was sent out with your tickets for service last year.\r\n- All of DPR division owned vehicles are titled to Wake County which requires emission inspections during the yearly vehicle inspection. The majority of our division owned vehicles are operated outside of Wake County. If you operate in a county which does not require emission inspections, you must seek a waiver from your local DMV officer before you can go and get your vehicle\'s yearly inspection. This does not apply if your county does require emission inspections. If you have further questions, you need to contact your District Maintenance Manager who is familiar with this process.\r\n\r\nAll parks with fuel tanks must report fuel issued to MFM Vehicles by the 10th of the month in the MoneyCounts database. To report fuel usage:\r\n - Go to the List of Databases website\r\n - Click the link for MoneyCounts\r\n - In the center of the Home page is a table with scores for different financial activities in the park. The activity names next to the scores are links and the link in the second row of the table is for \"Park Fuel (MF Vehicles).\"\r\n - Click the link for \"Park Fuel (MF Vehicle).\" Instructions for adding the fuel usage can be found on that screen by clicking the blue \"i\" circle in the bar that stretches across the screen.\r\n     \r\nEmail Text about attached MFM Mileage Sheet:\r\nGood morning everyone!\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have motor fleet vehicles issued by DOA, please use the attached form from January 2016 forward.  It will automatically calculate your total miles and if you put in your rate per mile (if youâ€™re unsure what that is, please let me know and I can give that info to you.) it will calculate all the rest for you.  This will also ensure that the standard insurance rate of $35.00 is always applied to your vehicle total amount due.\r\n\r\n***Also, there are drivers that seem to think the $35 does not apply to their car.  There has been some confusion among staff about this.  Please let them know that it is the insurance rate that is charged for each vehicle per month â€“ regardless of the mileage.  In the past, they have been charged even when this was not calculated.

You can use this to change items in-between parks.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.	After sending out an all-call on your item, your DISU or the CHOP will determine where the item will go.  They will do this when you provide the backup emails to them stating who has expressed interest in the item (these can be summarized by you in one short email to them).\r\n2.	Sending park will fill out form including the  â€œFromâ€ and  â€œToâ€ info and sign the paperwork.  \r\n3.	Scan and send to your DISU and CC me and your District Administrative Professional.\r\n4.	DISU will send their signed copy to me for CHOP approval.\r\n5.	Once CHOP approves, I will forward to the receiving park for their signature.\r\n6.	When complete, all parties will be notified by an email from me that they may transfer the item.\r\n\r\nIf there are questions regarding the new process, or questions regarding where your itemâ€™s approval is â€“ remember that the best way to reach me is by email and I am here to help!\r\n\r\nHeide Rumble, Accounting Clerk\r\nNC State Parks\r\n1615 MSC, Raleigh NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone: 919-707-9315\r\nFax: 919-715-5160\r\nheide.rumble@ncparks.gov\r\n\r\n\r\n4/26/2016 email from Heide to all DPR, See attached for any change of location items you need to process.

Also note that I am still working on the lost and found policy, which was sent to our lawyer yesterday.  As soon as we have a green-light, I will send it out officially.\r\n\r\nI have included the State Surplus Help link where I am able to get the contracts from on the â€œOil, Batteries, Paint and Tiresâ€ document, since thatâ€™s where you can find the contracts pertaining to those items.  But I have also put the contracts (as they are today) into the actual PDF documents themselves.\r\n\r\nOther questions asked during training were:\r\nâ€¢	Minimum on Oil pickup?  - yes, 100 Gallons of oil, and all other items in the contract are free with that pickup.  Oil will be pumped from your drums, the drums themselves will not be taken.\r\nâ€¢	Batteries: do we have to use this contract if we return the battery at the store to waive our core charge?  - no.  continue to return them to the store.  This is for parks that have mechanics and order their batteries in bulk of 5 or more at a time.\r\nâ€¢	Note that Park debris does not qualify for a landfill/scrap request, unless the item is of value (metal).  Logs, posts, and trash can be taken by your waste vendor.  If you have massive amounts of debris (like after a large storm) and it will not fit in your dumpster, you can contact Joanne Hunt and ask to have a special pickup or additional dumpster if needed.\r\nâ€¢	Aluminum and steel cans left at the park can either be part of your streamlined recycling program (due to quantity), or you can request them to be scrap metal.  The difference is that we pay money for the streamlined (or separated) recycle service as part of your trash contract (and they come and get it), and we get money for the scrap request (but you have to take it).  So, use your judgement for whatâ€™s right for your park.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you have any questions â€“ please let me know.\r\n\r\nHeide Rumble, Accounting Clerk\r\nNC State Parks\r\n1615 MSC, Raleigh NC 27699-1615\r\nPhone: 919-707-9315\r\nFax: 919-715-5160\r\nheide.rumble@ncparks.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n  ', '', '', '', '2016-04-04 08:15:11', '2022-08-26 17:10:30', '', 0, 'Williams', '', 580),

The DCR facility (historic site, museum, etc.) holding an event and/or providing space to a vendor, must maintain a daily registration list of all vendors participating in an event or selling or offering goods for sale at the DCR facility. The DCR facility should use the Sales & Use Tax Vendor List template for the vendor list.\r\n2.            The registration list must clearly and legibly show each vendor\'s name, permanent address, and Sales and Use Tax ID number. \r\n3.            Each vendor participating in an event or selling and offering goods for sale at a DCR facility must register with the DOR and obtain a Certificate of Registration. In order to obtain a Certificate of Registration, a person must complete form NC-BR Business Registration Application, available through online registration from the DOR website at:  http://www.dornc.com/electronic/registration/index.html. \r\nIf the DCR facility or vendors have questions, please contact Jonetta Appling of DOR at (336) 487-0203.\r\n4.            The DCR facility must require each vendor to exhibit a valid certificate of registration for visual inspection by the DCR facility at the time of registration; and must require each vendor to keep the Certificate of Registration noticeably displayed, so as to be visible for inspection by patrons of the vendor at the places or locations at which the goods are offered for sale. \r\n5.            Each vendor list must be retained by the DCR facility for no less than two years and must at any time be made available upon request to any law enforcement officer or the DOR Secretary or the Secretary\'s duly authorized agent. \r\n6.            The DOR requires DCR to submit in advance the list of all vendors registered prior to an event or prior to coming onsite to participate or sell goods. The DCR facility must email the completed Sales & Use Tax Event Vendor List template to the DCR Budget Office prior to an event.

Due to several factors: a new system, overwhelming demand after covid shutdown, and budget workflow changes; we are implementing a new surplus procedure and guidelines.  There are revised forms, and new processes so please take note.  You will also be able to find guidance on the FIND database for future reference.\r\n\r\nBeginning in October 2021, District OAâ€™s will now be handling your surplus requests.  The structure of approval has not changedâ€”you will still be required to have a PASU request an item to be surplused, DISU will need to approve it, and then CHOP/DDOPS will also need final approval before anything can be keyed into the new system.  Once it is keyed into the system, we still must wait for DNCRâ€™s approval, and then Surplusâ€™ approval before we can take anything to an SSP approved scrap yard, SSP approved landfill, or surplus themselves (SSP).  So, please wait for your District OA to give you the go-ahead to take the items before you do.\r\n\r\nThere are new requirements with the SSP system.  It now asks us for the year that we purchased the item and how much we paid for it.  Though that is not difficult to find when the item is on FAS, it is almost impossible to know for those items not on FAS.  Please make your best guess.  And if the item is not on the FAS system, remember that the purchase price will have been below $2500.00.   \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a some good news when it comes to requirements on the surplus of vehicles.  While we still need to have the odometer reading, SSP no longer requires us to submit the odometer disclosure form.  So, that is one less piece of paperwork needed before we move forward.  In addition, you will be mailing your plates directly to the Raleigh office, instead of having to stop by DMV and get an FS20 receipt form.  So, that is two less steps!\r\n\r\nWhat has not changed is that you still have 30 days from the date of approval to get your items to either surplus, SSP approved scrapyard, or SSP approved landfill.  Once the 30-days passes, the item will drop out of the system and we have to start over from scratch.
