The addition of these lands to the State Parks System brings a large cluster of state and nationally significant sites, centered on the spectacular cliffs, rugged mountains, and unusually rich soils that line the gorge. With 36 rare plant species and 14 rare animal species, it is one of the major centers of biodiversity in the state.', 'Living on the Edge\\r\\nThe Rocky Broad River has cut through the mountainous terrain to create the 14-mile gorge.  This has created distinct geological features and a diversity of natural community types including low elevation rocky summit and low elevation granitic dome.  These areas are often too steep or rocky to support a closed forest canopy and many rare plant and animal species have adapted to such harsh environmental conditions.  The area\\\'s highest peaks and steep slopes host bird species relatively uncommon to the region.  Peregrine falcon and ravens prefer these rocky exposed cliffs to lay their eggs.  Rocky outcrops facing north also support unique plant species such as roundleaf serviceberry, Biltmore sedge, and eastern shooting star.

The area is still seismically active with a magnitude 3.1 earthquake 8 miles south of Lake Lure in 2007 and historical earthquake reports in the late 1800\\\'s giving Rumbling Bald its name. The Rocky Broad River carves a path 1,800 feet deep through the gorge, ending in man-made Lake Lure. On either side of the river, steep exposed cliffs underscore vegetated ridge tops, demonstrating two distinctly different types of bedrock. The forces of expanding ice between cracks in the cliffs and gravity cause large pieces of cliff to break off.

The forest was a historic home to species dependent upon longleaf pine including the red cockaded woodpecker and the eastern fox squirrel. Today, other wildlife typically found on the park include white-tailed deer, black bear, gray squirrels, eastern wild turkey, cottontail rabbit, barred owls, and eastern coyote.  Two venomous snakes, the eastern cottonmouth and the southern copperhead, are commonplace on the park in their respective habitats.rn         rnThe main geologic feature of the park is the multi-layered cliffs along the banks of the Neuse River just west of Seven Springs.  The steep, colorful cliffs are not only an important scenic resource; they are also a valuable educational resource that provides visitors with a view back through time.   Most of the exposed cliff layers belong to the Black Creek Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous period more than 66 million years ago. Park programs and museum exhibits demonstrate the geologic processes that formed the cliffs and how geologists and paleontologists observe landforms and fossils to create a picture of the geography, climate and life forms of the Cretaceous period.  rnrnCurrently, the park features at least four different types of aquatic habitat: the Neuse River and its floodplain; two small creeks; one man-made lake, and a wetland bog area that was formerly known as Hickory Hill pond.

', 'Formation of the Great Dismal Swamp\r\nThe basic hydrologic requirements for the formation and development of large peat swamps are a humid climate with reasonable uniform rainfall throughout the year, and restricted drainage, both surface and subsurface.  The thick, rather impervious clay which underlies the area is an effective seal, preventing either downward or upward movement of water.  These unique wetland conditions offer habitat to many distinct plant communities, black bears and over 150 species of birds. \r\n\r\nThe History of Human Activity in the Swamp\r\nThe commercial and agricultural values of the swamp were explored soon after it was discovered by Colonists, including draining the whole area by ditching.  The first canal, now called the Washington Ditch, was probably dug in the late 1760\'s to facilitate the harvesting and removal of the timber.  During the mid-1800\'s, hundreds of shingle flatboats, picturesque passenger ships and freighters plied its length.  This had a great effect on the Dismal Swamp as more and more timber was cut and shipped out via the canal and the numerous ditches cut for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRestoration of Natural Processes in the Swamp\r\nWhen the swamp was drained, the drier conditions allowed species such as maple and sweet gums to replace the Atlantic white cedar and cypress.  Fire suppression also appears to be detrimental to cedar and cypress.  A natural-resource management objective of the park is to help restore these natural forces.  Water control structures are being placed in some of the ditches to help restore the area\'s natural hydrology.

Five accesses -- Cabe Lands, Cole Mill, Few\'s Ford, Pleasant Green, and Pump Station -- offer entry into this largely unspoiled river environment.', 'River Basin Ecology\r\nAs the park\'s primary natural feature, the Eno River provides the greatest resource for park staff to present interpretation and environmental education to the visiting public.  The Eno River watershed is part of the Neuse River Basin, one of the most heavily populated river basins in North Carolina. As the populations in Durham and Orange counties continue to grow, humans affect water quality, water quantity, and aquatic life from the headwaters of the Eno River in Orange County all the way to the estuaries of the Pamlico Sound.  Interpretive programs focus on aquatic life and the importance of the interrelationships between flora, fauna, and humans to the health of the river ecosystem.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThe Eno River Valley has a rich human history, beginning with numerous Native American tribes that first settled the riverbanks to the more recent developments that threaten the river ecosystem.  Programs emphasize the settlement of the area from the 1750s to the early 1900s, while highlighting the milling community.  Mill sites, home sites, cemeteries, roads, fords, and signs of agriculture remain for park staff to interpret. Park staff tell the unique story of the park\'s creation, sharing how the Eno River Association formed to protect the river valley from development and how the Association continues to support the park through land acquisition and preservation.\r\n\r\nWildlife Habitat Conservation\r\nThe single greatest threat to habitats of the Eno River Valley is development.  As Orange and Durham counties continue to grow, land acquisition and management are critical.  The park provides crucial habitat -- food, water, shelter, and space -- for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by conserving riparian forests and mature upland forests.  Park programming covers the identification of habitats and their importance to the health of wildlife populations. \r\n\r\nGeologic Features\r\nThe metavolcanic rock lying under the water\'s surface and scattered about the valley tells the story of the Eno River\'s formation. Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area includes the highest point in Orange County at 867 feet and numerous rock outcrops demonstrating evidence of ancient volcanic activity.  The recent publication by the North Carolina Geologic Survey, A Geologic Adventure Along the Eno River, interprets the many geologic features found along the park\'s trails and is an invaluable resource for park staff and the public.', '', '2015-08-21 18:38:53', 4);

Singer Sewing Machine Company purchased the property and used it for logging purposes in the 1920\\\'s and 1930\\\'s.  Due to its steep topography and high levels of annual rainfall, the Gorges tract and surrounding lands offered potential for the development of hydro power projects.  This potential use enticed Duke Energy Corporation to purchase the property between 1940 and 1960.  In the late 1970\\\'s, Duke began conducting conservation studies and limiting access to the property to protect the environment.  Nearly 275 acres were placed on the North Carolina Registry of Natural Heritage Areas in 1982 due to the presence of numerous rare species.  By the late 1990\\\'s, Duke Energy had determined that it no longer needed large areas of the Gorges property and offered to sell the land to both North and South Carolina.  The State of North Carolina purchased 10,000 acres in Transylvania County in 1999 and established Gorges State Park and the adjacent Toxaway Game Land.rnrnA significant geologic feature from which the park derives its name, is the abundance of deep gorges created in part by a dramatic change in elevation of over 2,000 feet in a little over three miles.  This abrupt transition, combined with the high levels of annual rainfall and a large drainage area, produces an abundance of waterfalls that visitors seek and enjoy.  Gorges State Park is unique within the state parks system in that it straddles two major geologic provinces and the Brevard Fault Zone, which separates the two.  The Brevard Fault Zone, one of the major ancient fault zones of the Appalachians, contains unusual rock types such as mylonite and marble.  Mass slope movement features, such as the large slide on the east side of the Toxaway River, are evident.  In addition, many boulder and cobble deposits have been identified along an 8,000-foot reach of the Toxaway River, attributed to flooding that followed an earthen dam failure at Lake Toxaway during August of 1916.rnrnThe exceptional terrain and climate within Gorges State Park has made possible a rich and unusual assemblage of flora and fauna.  The large and unbroken natural landscape includes high quality examples of extensive natural communities such as Montane Oak-Hickory Forest, Chestnut Oak Forest, and Acidic Cove Forest, and widespread Pine-Oak/Health Forest, Rich Cove Forest and Spray Cliff Forest, uncommon natural communities, occur in small patches within the park.  The area contains a concentration of rare plants, such as Southern Oconee Bells (Shortia galacifolia var galacifolia), that is significant for the state and the entire southern Appalachians.  A particularly rich assortment of bryophytes and ferns, including a species more common to the tropical forests of Central America, is presumably owed to the high moisture and sheltered temperatures of the gorges.  The animal diversities of natural communities in the park are also high, and rare mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates are present.rnrnThe park\\\'s river and streams combine with topography to create a variety of scenic waterfalls that draw visitors to the park.  Powerful waterfalls plunging over rocky cliffs, falls shrouded in mist, cascading waters and riffles offer sights and sounds that are among the park\\\'s more significant features.  Higher up, ridge-top vistas extend for miles, offering panoramas of tree-blanketed slopes, rugged mountain ranges and lush vegetation.  Overlooks offer spectacular views of the surrounding natural landscape, with the view from the Bearwallow Valley observation deck stretching up to 20 miles into South Carolina on clear days.  Whether listening to the thunder of Bearwallow Falls, breathing in the rich, organic smells of the forests, or seeing the trees shimmer in a breeze along the mountainside, visitors find their time spent in the park to be both exhilarating and peaceful.rnrnGorges State Park offers many recreational opportunities that immerse visitors in its rich natural resources.  Diverse bird species, from breeding residents to neotopical migrants, lure both the amateur and serious bird-watcher.  Miles of trails offer hikers a range of experiences, Bearwallow Valley Over Look Trail tot he Upper Bearwallow Falls  trail conveniently accessed from teh Bearwallow  picnic area, to rugged overnight backpacking adventures deep within the park.  Some old roadbeds are sufficiently constructed to allow a mix of trail uses such as horseback riding and mountain biking.  Opportunities exist for  picnicking, primitive camping.  Fishing is permitted in the park\\\'s river and streams.  The park\\\'s large amount of undeveloped land and rugged terrain creates exceptional opportunities for visitors to experience wilderness.rnrnDespite the rugged topography that typifies this portion of North Carolina, the area encompassed by the park has a history of human use that covers several thousand years.  Archaeological investigations have documented numerous sites and features throughout the park.  These include pre-historic sites used by Indians, such as small hunting camps, as well as historic sites used by European settlers, such as homesteads and cemeteries.  The earliest pre-historic sites are believed to be up to 8,000 years in age, and sites established by Europeans date to the early 1700\\\'s.rnrnGorges State Park exists primarily so its outstanding geologic, biologic and scenic features can be protected, and also for its recreational and archaeological resources.  The Division of Parks and Recreation is charged with preserving these values and providing experiences within its units that promote pride in and understanding of the valuable natural heritage of North Carolina.  rn', 'Plunging waterfalls, rugged river gorges, sheer rock walls and one of the greatest concentrations of rare and unique species in the eastern United States are found within Gorges State Park.

Currently, Gorges encompasses nearly 7,500 acres and is the only state park west of Asheville.rnrn', 'The Steep Terrain of the Blue Ridge EscarpmentrnGorges State Park lies within the Blue Ridge Escarpment, a wide strip of steep, highly dissected land that drops sharply from the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the adjoining Piedmont lowlands.  In the park, the escarpment falls from its highest elevation of 3,200 feet to its lowest elevation of 1,200 feet in a distance of only four miles! The park is an ideal place to study geology. The escarpment includes many striking landforms such as large overhangs, cliffs, pavement outcrops, cascades and waterfalls. rnrnWet Climate and Abundant Surface WatersrnThe park is a very wet place, receiving an average of 80 to 90 inches of rainfall each year.  These rains supply the abundant surface waters, which are the main source of weathering and erosion in the park and throughout the Blue Ridge Escarpment.  The escarpment has the highest concentration of waterfalls and spray cliffs in eastern North America.  The wet gorges and spray cliffs host an amazing diversity of amphibians and tropical plants. rnrnNatural Communities and Rare SpeciesrnBecause it is located in the transition zone between the Piedmont and mountains, the Blue Ridge Escarpment is a refuge for a diverse assortment of species and natural community types. The steep elevation gradient in the park creates differences in hydrology, soils and climate over very short distances, allowing for an ever-changing mosaic of natural communities. Unexpected combination of Piedmont and mountain species occur, and of the 114 natural community types found in North Carolina, 16 have been documented in the park.  These community types range from high-elevation hardwood forests to low-elevation cove forests, and include communities associated with waterfalls and spray cliffs.  The deep river gorges harbor an array of isolated species that are tropical in origin.  As a result, biologists refer to the escarpment as \\\"the tropics in the mountains\\\".', 'Grassy Ridge Access Area:  located in Sapphire, 0.7 miles south on Hwy-281s and is the location of the Visitor Center, Bearwallow and White Pines Picnic areas and the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.rnrnRainbow Falls Trail:  This strenuous 3.0-mile trail travels west out of Gorges State Park and into the Pisgah National Forest, is located at the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.

During inclement weather the Swinging Bridge and top of the Attraction are closed with no vehicle access to the top â€“ this may include fog, heavy rain or high winds.\r\n<hr>\r\n<b>For Your Pets Safety</b>\r\nDOGS MUST BE LEASHED AT ALL TIMES in the state park. This is for the safety of the dog, safety of other hikers, and protection of the animals and plants that live on this mountain. Juncos (small gray and black birds) are nesting now in the banks along the trail.  An unleashed dog can find a junco nest and easily disturb, or even kill all its occupants before the dog\'s owners arrive.\r\n\r\nOur trails are steep and rocky with over a dozen ladder climbs on the ridgeline and higher elevations. Many dogs have been injured on these sections of trails. It is very difficult for hikers to maintain a dog\'s leash on the difficult sections. For these reasons we do not recommend hiking with dogs on the Grandfather Trail, Cragway Trail, or upper portions of the Daniel Boone Scout and Profile trails.\r\n<hr>\r\n><b> Monitor local weather before heading out on the trails</b> - We recommend that hikers always check forecasted weather conditions before hiking on Grandfather Mountain, especially in the winter months.

Towering nearly a vertical mile over the Piedmont, Grandfather has been recognized for centuries as a sentinel summit. In 1794, the mountain\'s dramatic views convinced the Botanist Andre Michaux that he\'d climbed \"the highest peak in all North America.\" From alpine-like vegetation and vistas on the highest peaks, to cascading streams far down in the foothills, more than a dozen distinct ecological zones stretch across the landscape. Seventy-plus species of rare, threatened and endangered plants and animals populate this rugged mountain, making it one of the East\'s most significant peaks; a United Nations International Biosphere Reserve. The park is known for some of the South\'s most severe weather and challenging hiking trails. Be preparedâ€”at times, hikers climb ladders up cliffs. Nature lovers and hikers alike find Grandfather Mountain to be a special, indeed globally significant place to encounter the outdoors. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, agreement was reached for the state parks system to acquire 2,456 acres of Grandfather Mountain to become North Carolinaâ€™s newest state park.

Elementary students participate in activities from the EELE (Environmental Education Learning Experience), Predators and Prey, which emphasizes the bald eagle and its prey.  In both the EELE and interpretive programs, human impacts on food chains and animal habitats are discussed and stewardship is encouraged.rnrnCultural HistoryrnThis theme highlights the past human history of the New Hope River Valley.

In 1989, it was designated by the General Assembly as a State River and, later, named as a National Wild and Scenic River.   Along with these designations comes the responsibility of the state and its citizens to maintain the excellent water quality of the river and its tributaries.  Educational programs within this theme emphasize stewardship and include major concepts such as watershed; river basin; water quality monitoring; water chemistry; sources of water pollution in the river basin; the dependence of aquatic life on water quality; and the relationship of water quality to the surrounding landforms, natural communities and human populations. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities within the Lumber River Corridor\r\nThe Lumber River\'s significant biological resources include the natural communities of the river, its floodplains and uplands.  Educational programs in this theme area focus on the communities of the river channel and backwaters; the communities of the bottomland, swamp and sandbar typical of most blackwater rivers; and the variety of upland communities within the proposed park river corridor.   Unusual upland communities, which add to the beauty and scenic character of the river, include the extremely dry, barren sand hills on relict sand dune deposits.  Many acres of uplands are fire dependent and must be managed with prescribed fire since natural fire regimes are no longer possible.  Ensuring that the public understands the role of prescribed fire in maintaining these communities is crucial to securing the position of prescribed fire as a management tool.  \r\n\r\nWater-based Recreation and Safety\r\nThe 102-mile-long Lumber River offers a variety of scenic resources as it meanders through North Carolina\'s Coastal Plain.   Many people enjoy canoeing, fishing and kayaking on the river as well as hiking and picnicking along its banks.  While providing these recreational opportunities to an expanding human population, we must also maintain the quality of the resource.  Educational programs in this theme area stress stewardship and aquatic safety.  Park staff helps visitors and others to enjoy the river in a responsible manner and to participate in its continued protection.

Mitchell.   It answers a frequently-asked question of park visitors: What is happening to the trees?  Scientists have yet to determine exactly what is responsible for the massive dying of Mount Mitchell\'s Fraser fir and red spruce trees.  Natural causes include insect damage, especially the balsam woolly adelgid; ice storms; high winds; drought; and the age of trees.  But natural factors alone are not sufficient explanation.  Research indicates a correlation between air pollution and forest decline.  In fact, four out of five days, Mt. Mitchell is covered in clouds and fog, sometimes as acidic as vinegar.  Subjected to such pollution, a healthy tree becomes weak and is unable to fight off natural stresses it could otherwise resist.\r\n\r\nBiological Islands in the Sky\r\nThis theme focuses on the unique plants and animals associated with the mountains in the southern Appalachians that are over 5,500 feet in elevation.  The spruce-fir forest on these high southern mountains forms islands in the sky, disjunct from each other and from those in southern Canada, which Mt. Mitchell\'s most closely resemble.', 'Trails: Choose between a short stroll or a long hike into the woods.\r\nHikers should wear appropriate clothing and carry proper gear as\r\nthe high altitude makes the climate of Mount Mitchell chilly, even\r\nin summer.

Students and other park visitors can participate the park\'s Environmental Education Learning Experience activities and interpretive programs that help them discover the composition geologic history of Raven Rock.  They can also explore the gravel terraces on higher ridges within the park that were deposited on top of the Raven Rock feature by the ancestral Cape Fear River.  And, they can observe how the modern Cape Fear River continues to sculpt and erode the rock today, such as at Fish Traps and Lanier Falls. \r\n\r\nThe Ecology of the Fall Zone\r\nAs a result of its unique position in the fall zone, the park harbors a remarkable diversity of natural communities and species. The park is located in Harnett County where the Piedmont, Sandhills and Coastal Plain come together.  Thus, ecological characteristics of all three regions are found within the park.  Of particular significance are examples of several natural communities, Piedmont/Mountain Levee Forest and remnant examples of Piedmont Longleaf Pine Forest. Interpretive programs, guided trail hikes and a self-guided nature trail allow park visitors to explore relationships between the geology and the fauna and flora, e.g., flat rocks, cliff faces, vernal pools, basic soils.  Visitors can also learn to recognize the natural communities that identify the Piedmont/Coastal Plain interface.\r\n\r\nNatural and Cultural History of the Cape Fear River\r\nVisitors learn about the natural and cultural history of the Cape Fear River.  The headwaters originate in the central and eastern Piedmont with a drainage basin about 3,400 square miles upstream from the park.  Bisected by the Cape Fear River, Raven Rock State Park provides an excellent location to study our state\'s largest river basin.  Visitors and students can explore several of the streams in the park that feed the river, test water quality and examine macro-invertebrates. The park has a rich cultural history related to the river.  Prior to development of the railroad system in the late 1800s, the Cape Fear River was the primary artery of transportation for people and goods between Wilmington and points inland.

General Assembly authorized a new state park in the scenic Hickory Nut Gorge area of western Rutherford and the surrounding counties of Polk, Henderson and Buncombe. Later that year, the first tract of land to form the state park was purchased. Since then many more acres have been added. The most notable was the 2007 transfer of Chimney Rock Park, a private nature park surrounding the striking 315-foot spire on the gorge\'s southern side, into the expanding park.\r\n\r\nThe daily services offered to visitors of the Chimney Rock Access of the state park are provided by a private contract managed by the Division of Parks and Recreation.  This section is open year round with the exception of Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Entry fees offset the cost of operating this popular tourist destination. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Chimney Rock and the Rumbling Bald Climbing Access are the only public accesses within Chimney Rock State Park.

General Assembly authorized a new state park in the scenic Hickory Nut Gorge area of western Rutherford and surrounding counties. The unit was designated as Chimney Rock State Park shortly after the state had acquired Chimney Rock Park, a private nature park surrounding the striking 315-foot spire on the gorge\'s southern side.  In 1902, Lucius B. Morse bought the site. The Morse family developed park facilities including a tunnel and elevator to the rock summit, a visitor center, nature center and a network of hiking trails to geologic points of interest and the 404-foot-tall Hickory Nut Falls.\r\n\r\nThe greater Chimney Rock State Park currently encompasses roughly 5,900 acres on both north and south sides of the gorge and expansion efforts continue to bring more of the gorge\'s rich natural resources into conservation. The primary sections of the park are Chimney Rock, World\'s Edge, and Rumbling Bald.  The addition of these lands to the State Parks System brings a large cluster of state and nationally significant sites, centered on the spectacular cliffs, rugged mountains, and unusually rich soils that line the gorge. With 36 rare plant species and 14 rare animal species, it is one of the major centers of biodiversity in the state.','Living on the Edge\r\nThe Rocky Broad River has cut through the mountainous terrain to create the 14-mile gorge.  This has created distinct geological features and a diversity of natural community types including low elevation rocky summit and low elevation granitic dome.  These areas are often too steep or rocky to support a closed forest canopy and many rare plant and animal species have adapted to such harsh environmental conditions.  The area\'s highest peaks and steep slopes host bird species relatively uncommon to the region.  Peregrine falcon and ravens prefer these rocky exposed cliffs to lay their eggs.  Rocky outcrops facing north also support unique plant species such as roundleaf serviceberry, Biltmore sedge, and eastern shooting star.  Life on these outcrops and cliff faces has teetered on the edge for many of these rare species, but with the continued protection of these incredible places they should be able to hang on.\r\n\r\nGeologic Forces Behind the Stunning Scenery of Hickory Nut Gorge\r\nThe magnificent cliffs at Chimney Rock State Park tell the story of nearly 500 million years of geologic forces.	These unhurried forces include ancient volcanic activity, heat and pressure miles beneath the earth\'s surface, plate tectonics and erosion. The area is still seismically active with a magnitude 3.1 earthquake 8 miles south of Lake Lure in 2007 and historical earthquake reports in the late 1800\'s giving Rumbling Bald its name. The Rocky Broad River carves a path 1,800 feet deep through the gorge, ending in man-made Lake Lure. On either side of the river, steep exposed cliffs underscore vegetated ridge tops, demonstrating two distinctly different types of bedrock. The forces of expanding ice between cracks in the cliffs and gravity cause large pieces of cliff to break off. These ongoing rockslides result in remarkable landforms including Chimney Rock, numerous caves and tunnels, and jagged cliff faces.','x','2016-10-27 18:21:02',46),('CHSW','','','','','Gates','36.401942','-76.904984','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','0','','','','','','2019-04-26 16:03:52',76),('CLNE','240 Park Entrance Road','','Seven Springs','28578','Wayne','35.2354','-77.8932','cliffs.neuse@ncparks.gov','(919) 778-6234','','','','(919) 778-7447','Park Hours:\r\nWinter (Dec., Jan., & Feb.): 7:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.\r\nSpring (March & April): 7:00 a.m.-9:00 p.m.    \r\nSummer (May-Sept.): 7:00 a.m.-10:00 p.m.\r\nFall (Oct. & Nov.): 7:00 a.m.-8:00 p.m.\r\n     \r\nVisitor Center: 9:00 a.m - 5:00 p.m. daily; including weekends; Visitor Center may be closed for one-hour at midday on weekends.

The mission of the state parks system is to conserve and protect representative examples of the natural beauty, ecological features and recreational resources of statewide significance; to provide outdoor recreational opportunities in a safe and healthy environment; and to provide environmental education opportunities that promote stewardship of the state\'s natural heritage. ','Cliffs of the Neuse State Park presently features a 35-site family campground (dump station for R.V. users/no electricity) and a four-site group campground (restrooms/no showers/shared water) for groups. The park\'s primary attraction during the summer season is its 11-acre swim lake and concession that are open daily Memorial Day-Labor Day for swimming and water activities(lifeguards on duty during season).  The park is presently about 1,100 acres in size and borders the Neuse River for about two miles.  Fishing is permitted in the river and anglers have good access at the base of the 350-yard Trail to target rockfish, shad, largemouth bass, bream or catfish depending upon the season.  The Visitor Center features natural and cultural displays and offers a 1,000 sq. ft. auditorium that is available for public and private organization use by fee.  Also featured is the park\'s 1800 sq. ft. picnic shelter (adjacent to restrooms) which may be reserved by fee also. Those with disabilities are permitted to drive to the picnic shelter upon request.  Weddings are permitted by reservation on the Swim Lake beach from Sept. 10-May. 10.','Cliffs of the Neuse State Park features two distinct forest types; bottomland bald cypress swamp adjacent to the Neuse River and upland longleaf pine forest that is augmented with a variety of hardwoods including southern red oak, scarlet oak, blackjack oak, sassafras, and mockernut hickory.  The forest was a historic home to species dependent upon longleaf pine including the red cockaded woodpecker and the eastern fox squirrel. Today, other wildlife typically found on the park include white-tailed deer, black bear, gray squirrels, eastern wild turkey, cottontail rabbit, barred owls, and eastern coyote.  Two venomous snakes, the eastern cottonmouth and the southern copperhead, are commonplace on the park in their respective habitats.\r\n         \r\nThe main geologic feature of the park is the multi-layered cliffs along the banks of the Neuse River just west of Seven Springs.  The steep, colorful cliffs are not only an important scenic resource; they are also a valuable educational resource that provides visitors with a view back through time.   Most of the exposed cliff layers belong to the Black Creek Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous period more than 66 million years ago. Park programs and museum exhibits demonstrate the geologic processes that formed the cliffs and how geologists and paleontologists observe landforms and fossils to create a picture of the geography, climate and life forms of the Cretaceous period.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the park features at least four different types of aquatic habitat: the Neuse River and its floodplain; two small creeks; one man-made lake, and a wetland bog area that was formerly known as Hickory Hill pond.  These different habitats represent a valuable educational resource for school groups and others to study water quality and related environmental issues.  The water quality issues within the Neuse River basin have been widely reported and are of interest to many park visitors.','Six hiking trails totaling nearly six miles.  Trails are easy to moderate in terms of difficulty.  Park staff regularly schedule paddle trail excursions on the Neuse River by canoe and kayak.

All of this and more can be found just 3 miles south of the NC/VA border on US Hwy 17.     ','Formation of the Great Dismal Swamp\r\nThe basic hydrologic requirements for the formation and development of large peat swamps are a humid climate with reasonable uniform rainfall throughout the year, and restricted drainage, both surface and subsurface.  The thick, rather impervious clay which underlies the area is an effective seal, preventing either downward or upward movement of water.  These unique wetland conditions offer habitat to many distinct plant communities, black bears and over 150 species of birds. \r\n\r\nThe History of Human Activity in the Swamp\r\nThe commercial and agricultural values of the swamp were explored soon after it was discovered by Colonists, including draining the whole area by ditching.  The first canal, now called the Washington Ditch, was probably dug in the late 1760\'s to facilitate the harvesting and removal of the timber.  During the mid-1800\'s, hundreds of shingle flatboats, picturesque passenger ships and freighters plied its length.  This had a great effect on the Dismal Swamp as more and more timber was cut and shipped out via the canal and the numerous ditches cut for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRestoration of Natural Processes in the Swamp\r\nWhen the swamp was drained, the drier conditions allowed species such as maple and sweet gums to replace the Atlantic white cedar and cypress.  Fire suppression also appears to be detrimental to cedar and cypress.  A natural-resource management objective of the park is to help restore these natural forces.  Water control structures are being placed in some of the ditches to help restore the area\'s natural hydrology.  A prescribed burn program will benefit the area\'s native species.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',39),('EADI','345-B Park Entrance Rd.','','Seven Springs','28578','Wayne','','','','919-778-9488','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','The purpose statement for this park has not yet been entered.','','The interpretive themes for this park have not yet been entered.','','2020-04-02 20:45:38',45),('ELKN','5564 Meat Camp Road','','Todd','28684','Watauga, Ashe','36.332586','-81.69064','elk.knob@ncparks.gov','(828) 297-7261','','','','','Park Hours\r\nNovember - February, 7 a.m. - 6 p.m.\r\nMarch, April, May, September and October 7 a.m. - 8 p.m.\r\nJune - August 7 a.m. - 9 p.m.\r\nClosed Christmas Day\r\n\r\nPark Office Hours\r\n8 a.m. - 5 p.m. weekdays\r\nClosed state holidays','Elk Knob State Park is located in Watauga County approximately 9.5 miles north of Boone.\r\n\r\nTraveling north to Boone on US Highway 421, take NC 194 North approximately 4 miles and turn left onto Meat Camp Road.

Five accesses -- Cabe Lands, Cole Mill, Few\'s Ford, Pleasant Green, and Pump Station -- offer entry into this largely unspoiled river environment.','River Basin Ecology\r\nAs the park\'s primary natural feature, the Eno River provides the greatest resource for park staff to present interpretation and environmental education to the visiting public.  The Eno River watershed is part of the Neuse River Basin, one of the most heavily populated river basins in North Carolina. As the populations in Durham and Orange counties continue to grow, humans affect water quality, water quantity, and aquatic life from the headwaters of the Eno River in Orange County all the way to the estuaries of the Pamlico Sound.  Interpretive programs focus on aquatic life and the importance of the interrelationships between flora, fauna, and humans to the health of the river ecosystem.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThe Eno River Valley has a rich human history, beginning with numerous Native American tribes that first settled the riverbanks to the more recent developments that threaten the river ecosystem.  Programs emphasize the settlement of the area from the 1750s to the early 1900s, while highlighting the milling community.  Mill sites, home sites, cemeteries, roads, fords, and signs of agriculture remain for park staff to interpret. Park staff tell the unique story of the park\'s creation, sharing how the Eno River Association formed to protect the river valley from development and how the Association continues to support the park through land acquisition and preservation.\r\n\r\nWildlife Habitat Conservation\r\nThe single greatest threat to habitats of the Eno River Valley is development.  As Orange and Durham counties continue to grow, land acquisition and management are critical.  The park provides crucial habitat -- food, water, shelter, and space -- for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by conserving riparian forests and mature upland forests.  Park programming covers the identification of habitats and their importance to the health of wildlife populations. \r\n\r\nGeologic Features\r\nThe metavolcanic rock lying under the water\'s surface and scattered about the valley tells the story of the Eno River\'s formation. Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area includes the highest point in Orange County at 867 feet and numerous rock outcrops demonstrating evidence of ancient volcanic activity.  The recent publication by the North Carolina Geologic Survey, A Geologic Adventure Along the Eno River, interprets the many geologic features found along the park\'s trails and is an invaluable resource for park staff and the public.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',4),('FALA','13304 Creedmoor Rd.','','Wake Forest','27587','Wake, Durham ','36.0117','-78.6888','falls.lake@ncparks.gov','(984) 867-8000','','','','(984) 867-8029','<u>Park Hours</u>rnrn<b>FOR SPECIFIC RECREATION AREA SEASONS OF OPERATION SEE \\\'CURRENT CONDITIONS\\\'</b>rnrn<b>Day Use Areas</b>rnrnNovember - February, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.rnMarch - April and September - October, 8 a.m. - 8 p.m.rnMay - August, 8 a.m. - 9 p.m.rnClosed Christmas Dayrnrn<b> Campgrounds</b>rnrnRollingview campground offers 24 hour access year round.

Major concepts for interpretive programs include colonial nesting waterbirds, solitary nesting waterbirds, migration patterns, endangered species, bird identification, birds of prey, and park resource management efforts. The Environmental Education Learning Experience (EELE) investigates colonial nesting waterbirds active in the park during the summer months.\r\n\r\nSea Turtles\r\nThe park protects the threatened loggerhead sea turtle, which nests along the ocean front beach from May through August.   Interpretive programs and exhibits in this theme area include sea turtle nesting, life history, migration routes, protection efforts and threats to the turtle\'s survival. \r\n\r\nBarrier Spit Ecology\r\nFort Fisher is a barrier spit, a place of ever-changing sand and water.  Programs and other interpretive products in this theme area describe the dynamic geology as well as the plants and animals that have adapted to, and thrive in this unstable environment.  Topics include migrating inlets, sand movement along the beach, beach front erosion, human impacts on barrier spit ecology, dune development and successional vegetative communities.\r\n\r\nRecreation\r\nThis theme focuses on safety, beach access points and the main user activities: swimming, walking, nature study and fishing.

At the start of the Civil War, North Carolina seized the fort from Union forces, but it was later recaptured in 1862 during the only major battle involving Fort Macon.  After the Civil War, the fort was a federal prison, then garrisoned again during the Spanish-American War.  In 1924, Fort Macon became North Carolina\'s second state park.   The Civilian Conservation Corps restored the fort in 1934-35 and it was garrisoned for a final time during World War II.  Interpretation and education programming highlights living conditions at the fort, different uses of the fort throughout history, the fort\'s architecture and its military history.\r\n\r\nBarrier Island Dynamics\r\nThe geologic evolution of barrier islands is the second primary theme.  Major concepts in this theme area include: theories of barrier island formation and migration over time, dune movement and erosion, natural communities adapted to specific barrier island habitats, and human impacts on barrier island dynamics.

Singer Sewing Machine Company purchased the property and used it for logging purposes in the 1920\'s and 1930\'s.  Due to its steep topography and high levels of annual rainfall, the Gorges tract and surrounding lands offered potential for the development of hydro power projects.  This potential use enticed Duke Energy Corporation to purchase the property between 1940 and 1960.  In the late 1970\'s, Duke began conducting conservation studies and limiting access to the property to protect the environment.  Nearly 275 acres were placed on the North Carolina Registry of Natural Heritage Areas in 1982 due to the presence of numerous rare species.  By the late 1990\'s, Duke Energy had determined that it no longer needed large areas of the Gorges property and offered to sell the land to both North and South Carolina.  The State of North Carolina purchased 10,000 acres in Transylvania County in 1999 and established Gorges State Park and the adjacent Toxaway Game Land.\r\n\r\nA significant geologic feature from which the park derives its name, is the abundance of deep gorges created in part by a dramatic change in elevation of over 2,000 feet in a little over three miles.  This abrupt transition, combined with the high levels of annual rainfall and a large drainage area, produces an abundance of waterfalls that visitors seek and enjoy.  Gorges State Park is unique within the state parks system in that it straddles two major geologic provinces and the Brevard Fault Zone, which separates the two.  The Brevard Fault Zone, one of the major ancient fault zones of the Appalachians, contains unusual rock types such as mylonite and marble.  Mass slope movement features, such as the large slide on the east side of the Toxaway River, are evident.  In addition, many boulder and cobble deposits have been identified along an 8,000-foot reach of the Toxaway River, attributed to flooding that followed an earthen dam failure at Lake Toxaway during August of 1916.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional terrain and climate within Gorges State Park has made possible a rich and unusual assemblage of flora and fauna.  The large and unbroken natural landscape includes high quality examples of extensive natural communities such as Montane Oak-Hickory Forest, Chestnut Oak Forest, and Acidic Cove Forest, and widespread Pine-Oak/Health Forest, Rich Cove Forest and Spray Cliff Forest, uncommon natural communities, occur in small patches within the park.  The area contains a concentration of rare plants, such as Southern Oconee Bells (Shortia galacifolia var galacifolia), that is significant for the state and the entire southern Appalachians.  A particularly rich assortment of bryophytes and ferns, including a species more common to the tropical forests of Central America, is presumably owed to the high moisture and sheltered temperatures of the gorges.  The animal diversities of natural communities in the park are also high, and rare mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates are present.\r\n\r\nThe park\'s river and streams combine with topography to create a variety of scenic waterfalls that draw visitors to the park.  Powerful waterfalls plunging over rocky cliffs, falls shrouded in mist, cascading waters and riffles offer sights and sounds that are among the park\'s more significant features.  Higher up, ridge-top vistas extend for miles, offering panoramas of tree-blanketed slopes, rugged mountain ranges and lush vegetation.  Overlooks offer spectacular views of the surrounding natural landscape, with the view from the Bearwallow Valley observation deck stretching up to 20 miles into South Carolina on clear days.  Whether listening to the thunder of Bearwallow Falls, breathing in the rich, organic smells of the forests, or seeing the trees shimmer in a breeze along the mountainside, visitors find their time spent in the park to be both exhilarating and peaceful.\r\n\r\nGorges State Park offers many recreational opportunities that immerse visitors in its rich natural resources.  Diverse bird species, from breeding residents to neotopical migrants, lure both the amateur and serious bird-watcher.  Miles of trails offer hikers a range of experiences, Bearwallow Valley Over Look Trail tot he Upper Bearwallow Falls  trail conveniently accessed from teh Bearwallow  picnic area, to rugged overnight backpacking adventures deep within the park.  Some old roadbeds are sufficiently constructed to allow a mix of trail uses such as horseback riding and mountain biking.  Opportunities exist for  picnicking, primitive camping.  Fishing is permitted in the park\'s river and streams.  The park\'s large amount of undeveloped land and rugged terrain creates exceptional opportunities for visitors to experience wilderness.\r\n\r\nDespite the rugged topography that typifies this portion of North Carolina, the area encompassed by the park has a history of human use that covers several thousand years.  Archaeological investigations have documented numerous sites and features throughout the park.  These include pre-historic sites used by Indians, such as small hunting camps, as well as historic sites used by European settlers, such as homesteads and cemeteries.  The earliest pre-historic sites are believed to be up to 8,000 years in age, and sites established by Europeans date to the early 1700\'s.\r\n\r\nGorges State Park exists primarily so its outstanding geologic, biologic and scenic features can be protected, and also for its recreational and archaeological resources.  The Division of Parks and Recreation is charged with preserving these values and providing experiences within its units that promote pride in and understanding of the valuable natural heritage of North Carolina.  \r\n','Plunging waterfalls, rugged river gorges, sheer rock walls and one of the greatest concentrations of rare and unique species in the eastern United States are found within Gorges State Park.

Currently, Gorges encompasses nearly 7,500 acres and is the only state park west of Asheville.\r\n\r\n','The Steep Terrain of the Blue Ridge Escarpment\r\nGorges State Park lies within the Blue Ridge Escarpment, a wide strip of steep, highly dissected land that drops sharply from the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the adjoining Piedmont lowlands.  In the park, the escarpment falls from its highest elevation of 3,200 feet to its lowest elevation of 1,200 feet in a distance of only four miles! The park is an ideal place to study geology. The escarpment includes many striking landforms such as large overhangs, cliffs, pavement outcrops, cascades and waterfalls. \r\n\r\nWet Climate and Abundant Surface Waters\r\nThe park is a very wet place, receiving an average of 80 to 90 inches of rainfall each year.  These rains supply the abundant surface waters, which are the main source of weathering and erosion in the park and throughout the Blue Ridge Escarpment.  The escarpment has the highest concentration of waterfalls and spray cliffs in eastern North America.  The wet gorges and spray cliffs host an amazing diversity of amphibians and tropical plants. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities and Rare Species\r\nBecause it is located in the transition zone between the Piedmont and mountains, the Blue Ridge Escarpment is a refuge for a diverse assortment of species and natural community types. The steep elevation gradient in the park creates differences in hydrology, soils and climate over very short distances, allowing for an ever-changing mosaic of natural communities. Unexpected combination of Piedmont and mountain species occur, and of the 114 natural community types found in North Carolina, 16 have been documented in the park.  These community types range from high-elevation hardwood forests to low-elevation cove forests, and include communities associated with waterfalls and spray cliffs.  The deep river gorges harbor an array of isolated species that are tropical in origin.  As a result, biologists refer to the escarpment as \"the tropics in the mountains\".','Grassy Ridge Access Area:  located in Sapphire, 0.7 miles south on Hwy-281s and is the location of the Visitor Center, Bearwallow and White Pines Picnic areas and the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.\r\n\r\nRainbow Falls Trail:  This strenuous 3.0-mile trail travels west out of Gorges State Park and into the Pisgah National Forest, is located at the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.

Staff will not drive hikers from the attraction back to the trailheads. You must be off the trail and through the attraction gate before they close.  During inclement weather the Swinging Bridge and top of the Attraction are closed with no vehicle access to the top â€“ this may include fog, heavy rain or high winds.\r\n<hr>\r\n<b>For Your Pets Safety</b>\r\nDOGS MUST BE LEASHED AT ALL TIMES in the state park.

Juncos (small gray and black birds) are nesting now in the banks along the trail.  An unleashed dog can find a junco nest and easily disturb, or even kill all its occupants before the dog\'s owners arrive.\r\n\r\nOur trails are steep and rocky with over a dozen ladder climbs on the ridgeline and higher elevations. Many dogs have been injured on these sections of trails. It is very difficult for hikers to maintain a dog\'s leash on the difficult sections. For these reasons we do not recommend hiking with dogs on the Grandfather Trail, Cragway Trail, or upper portions of the Daniel Boone Scout and Profile trails.\r\n<hr>\r\n><b> Monitor local weather before heading out on the trails</b> - We recommend that hikers always check forecasted weather conditions before hiking on Grandfather Mountain, especially in the winter months.

Towering nearly a vertical mile over the Piedmont, Grandfather has been recognized for centuries as a sentinel summit. In 1794, the mountain\'s dramatic views convinced the Botanist Andre Michaux that he\'d climbed \"the highest peak in all North America.\" From alpine-like vegetation and vistas on the highest peaks, to cascading streams far down in the foothills, more than a dozen distinct ecological zones stretch across the landscape. Seventy-plus species of rare, threatened and endangered plants and animals populate this rugged mountain, making it one of the East\'s most significant peaks; a United Nations International Biosphere Reserve. The park is known for some of the South\'s most severe weather and challenging hiking trails. Be preparedâ€”at times, hikers climb ladders up cliffs. Nature lovers and hikers alike find Grandfather Mountain to be a special, indeed globally significant place to encounter the outdoors. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, agreement was reached for the state parks system to acquire 2,456 acres of Grandfather Mountain to become North Carolinaâ€™s newest state park.

Human land use in the watershed affects the lake\'s water quality.  Agricultural land use and urban land use in the watershed contributes to storm water runoff, adding an excess of sediment and nutrients to the lake.  Programs in this theme area focus on aquatic life, water quality and water quantity.  The popular C.A.S.T. (Catch, A Sure Thing) program introduces children to fish biology, fish identification, fishing techniques and outdoor ethics. Other aquatic programs such as \"Pond Life\" give visitors a hands-on experience with the aquatic life in one of the ponds in the park.\r\n\r\nArea Wildlife: Predator-Prey \r\nIn addition to predator-prey relationships, this theme includes related ecological concepts such as food chain, food web, habitat, adaptation and resource management.   Most visitors explore predator-prey relationships through interpretive talks and nature hikes that focus on the bald eagle and other area wildlife.  Elementary students participate in activities from the EELE (Environmental Education Learning Experience), Predators and Prey, which emphasizes the bald eagle and its prey.  In both the EELE and interpretive programs, human impacts on food chains and animal habitats are discussed and stewardship is encouraged.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThis theme highlights the past human history of the New Hope River Valley.  Archaeologists have explored the remains of 450 prehistoric and historic sites in the area and have uncovered many Indian artifacts.  Scottish Highlanders settled the area in the 1740s.  Interpretive programs illustrate how various cultures used the natural resources of the upper Cape Fear River Basin. The park hosts Heritage Day on the first Saturday of October to celebrate the cultural history of the area.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',14),('JORI','300 W.

Also, the February 2014 ice storm has likely dropped new trees into the river along with a large amount of major branches that likely have broken off trees and fallen into the river. If you choose to paddle on sections that park staff have not removed trees from, be prepared to have to portage around or over many new trees across the river.  The wider sections of the river, such as through Lumberton, and from the Boardman access at US 74 down to the SC state line, and beyond, are some of the better options to boat without having to deal with possibly many trees across the river channel.  These are very nice sections to boat on with all of them being part of the NC Natural and Scenic River System and the National Wild & Scenic River System.  These sections, along with the section at Chalk Banks from Turnpike Rd. to Hwy 401, have been cleared of trees by park staff.  A new down tree or two is possible even on these recently cleared sections.  All other sections will very likely have a significant amount of trees to have to portage.','2014-08-19 10:53:33','Princess Ann <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://maps.google.com/?q=34.390023,-79.002225\">34.390023, -79.002225</a> <br>Chalks Banks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://maps.google.com/?q=34.8987,-79.3549\">34.8987, -79.3549</a>\r\n\r\nThe Lumber River flows through the south-central portion of our state.

Add extra time for crossing exposed hazards and sandbars. All float times should include additional time to reach take-out points.','Water Quality of the Lumber River\r\nThe Lumber River is an excellent example of a Coastal Plain, blackwater river.  In 1989, it was designated by the General Assembly as a State River and, later, named as a National Wild and Scenic River.   Along with these designations comes the responsibility of the state and its citizens to maintain the excellent water quality of the river and its tributaries.  Educational programs within this theme emphasize stewardship and include major concepts such as watershed; river basin; water quality monitoring; water chemistry; sources of water pollution in the river basin; the dependence of aquatic life on water quality; and the relationship of water quality to the surrounding landforms, natural communities and human populations. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities within the Lumber River Corridor\r\nThe Lumber River\'s significant biological resources include the natural communities of the river, its floodplains and uplands.  Educational programs in this theme area focus on the communities of the river channel and backwaters; the communities of the bottomland, swamp and sandbar typical of most blackwater rivers; and the variety of upland communities within the proposed park river corridor.   Unusual upland communities, which add to the beauty and scenic character of the river, include the extremely dry, barren sand hills on relict sand dune deposits.  Many acres of uplands are fire dependent and must be managed with prescribed fire since natural fire regimes are no longer possible.  Ensuring that the public understands the role of prescribed fire in maintaining these communities is crucial to securing the position of prescribed fire as a management tool.  \r\n\r\nWater-based Recreation and Safety\r\nThe 102-mile-long Lumber River offers a variety of scenic resources as it meanders through North Carolina\'s Coastal Plain.   Many people enjoy canoeing, fishing and kayaking on the river as well as hiking and picnicking along its banks.  While providing these recreational opportunities to an expanding human population, we must also maintain the quality of the resource.  Educational programs in this theme area stress stewardship and aquatic safety.  Park staff helps visitors and others to enjoy the river in a responsible manner and to participate in its continued protection.  The CATCH (youth fishing) program and interpretive canoe hikes are popular educational programs in this theme area.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',19),('MAIS','','','','','','34.135961','-77.850685','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','2019-04-05 18:05:56',75),('MARI','500 Old Mayo Park Road','','Mayodan','27027','Rockingham','36.438800','-79.938171','mayo.river@ncparks.gov','(336) 427-2530','','','','(336) 427-2650','November - February      8am-6pm\r\nMarch, April             8am-8pm\r\nSeptember, October       8am-8pm\r\nMay - August             8am-9pm\r\nClosed Christmas Day\r\n\r\nPark Office Hours\r\n8am-5pm weekdays\r\nClosed state holidays','Mayo River State Park\'s Mayo Mountain Access is located in western Rockingham County near the towns of Mayodan and Stoneville, 30 minutes north of Greensboro, N.C. and 20 minutes south of Martinsville, Va.

Numerous bluffs are found along the river including one of only two Piedmont Calcareous Cliff communities in the state.   These xeric, rocky bluffs of calcite-cemented siltstone and sandstone in the Dan River Triassic Basin are home to rare plants and unique natural communities.

','Mount Jefferson rises abruptly to more than 1,600 feet above the surrounding landscape, serving as a landmark for area motorists. Acquaint yourself with this mighty peak by viewing it first from the Mount Jefferson Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Rising as a long, forested prominence, its dark color is conspicuous among neighboring peaks on the Ashe plateau.\r\n\r\nThough the mountain is magnificent from a distance, Mount Jefferson is best appreciated up close. On a clear day, you can see for miles from its peak. A great part of Ashe County spreads out below; fields, farms, forests and mountains mingle in kaleidoscopic patterns. On the horizon, the Blue Ridge Mountains form a striking backdrop.\r\n\r\nYet what looms in the distance is no more spectacular than what is right before your eyes, for the forests of Mount Jefferson are a botanical paradise. The interesting and unusual plant life of the park rendered it worthy of designation as a national natural landmark.','Geology\r\nMount Jefferson appears to be an inselberg, an isolated mountain surrounded by mountain ranges.  The outcrops provide an excellent opportunity for interpretive study of the formation and subsequent erosion of the southern Appalachian Mountains.\r\n\r\nUnique Plant Communities\r\nMount Jefferson contains a diversified aggregation of unique plant communities, including many disjunct species that usually occur farther north.  For example, the population of big toothed aspen on the north-facing slope of the mountain is more commonly seen from West Virginia to Canada.\r\n','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',23),('MOMI','2388 State Highway 128','','Burnsville','28714','Yancey','35.7528','-82.2737','mount.mitchell@ncparks.gov','(828) 675-4611','','','','','Park Hours\r\nNovember - February, 7 a.m. - 6 p.m.\r\nMarch, April, - 7 a.m. - 8 p.m.\r\nSeptember and October, 7 a.m. - 9 p.m.\r\nMay - August, 7 a.m. - 10 p.m.\r\nClosed Christmas Day\r\n\r\nPark Office Hours\r\n\r\n8 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday, April through October\r\n8 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, November through March\r\n\r\nRestaurant Hours <b>828-675-1024</b> \r\n\r\nMay 1 - August 31, 10:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., daily\r\nSeptember 1 - October 31, 10:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., daily\r\n\r\nConcession Stand / Gift Shop Hours\r\n\r\nMay - October, 10:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., daily','Mount Mitchell State Park is located in Yancey County, 33 miles north of Asheville off the Blue Ridge Parkway at mile marker #355. \r\n\r\n<b>From the West</b>\r\n\r\nFrom Asheville, take the Blue Ridge Parkway north to mile marker #355 and turn left onto NC 128, which leads to the park.

The story of the formation of the southern Appalachians through structural disturbance of the earth\'s crust will be depicted, along with the nature of present-day landform features.\r\n\r\nForest Decline\r\nThis theme includes explanations of how weather, soils, plants, animals and air pollution impact the spruce-fir forest on Mt. Mitchell.   It answers a frequently-asked question of park visitors: What is happening to the trees?  Scientists have yet to determine exactly what is responsible for the massive dying of Mount Mitchell\'s Fraser fir and red spruce trees.  Natural causes include insect damage, especially the balsam woolly adelgid; ice storms; high winds; drought; and the age of trees.  But natural factors alone are not sufficient explanation.  Research indicates a correlation between air pollution and forest decline.  In fact, four out of five days, Mt. Mitchell is covered in clouds and fog, sometimes as acidic as vinegar.  Subjected to such pollution, a healthy tree becomes weak and is unable to fight off natural stresses it could otherwise resist.\r\n\r\nBiological Islands in the Sky\r\nThis theme focuses on the unique plants and animals associated with the mountains in the southern Appalachians that are over 5,500 feet in elevation.  The spruce-fir forest on these high southern mountains forms islands in the sky, disjunct from each other and from those in southern Canada, which Mt. Mitchell\'s most closely resemble.','Trails: Choose between a short stroll or a long hike into the woods.\r\nHikers should wear appropriate clothing and carry proper gear as\r\nthe high altitude makes the climate of Mount Mitchell chilly, even\r\nin summer. A short trail beginning at the summit parking lot leads to the\r\nobservation area. On a clear day, visitors can see as far as 85 miles and\r\nenjoy spectacular views of the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\nAlthough no horses are permitted inside the park, horseback riders\r\ncan enjoy a trail that travels along the perimeter of the park.\r\nFor more information, contact the US Forest Service Appalachian\r\nRanger District, (828) 689-8716.\r\n\r\nWinter Advisory: Be advised sections of trails are ice covered for several months of the year.

Students and other park visitors can participate the park\'s Environmental Education Learning Experience activities and interpretive programs that help them discover the composition geologic history of Raven Rock.  They can also explore the gravel terraces on higher ridges within the park that were deposited on top of the Raven Rock feature by the ancestral Cape Fear River.  And, they can observe how the modern Cape Fear River continues to sculpt and erode the rock today, such as at Fish Traps and Lanier Falls. \r\n\r\nThe Ecology of the Fall Zone\r\nAs a result of its unique position in the fall zone, the park harbors a remarkable diversity of natural communities and species. The park is located in Harnett County where the Piedmont, Sandhills and Coastal Plain come together.  Thus, ecological characteristics of all three regions are found within the park.  Of particular significance are examples of several natural communities, Piedmont/Mountain Levee Forest and remnant examples of Piedmont Longleaf Pine Forest. Interpretive programs, guided trail hikes and a self-guided nature trail allow park visitors to explore relationships between the geology and the fauna and flora, e.g., flat rocks, cliff faces, vernal pools, basic soils.  Visitors can also learn to recognize the natural communities that identify the Piedmont/Coastal Plain interface.\r\n\r\nNatural and Cultural History of the Cape Fear River\r\nVisitors learn about the natural and cultural history of the Cape Fear River.  The headwaters originate in the central and eastern Piedmont with a drainage basin about 3,400 square miles upstream from the park.  Bisected by the Cape Fear River, Raven Rock State Park provides an excellent location to study our state\'s largest river basin.  Visitors and students can explore several of the streams in the park that feed the river, test water quality and examine macro-invertebrates. The park has a rich cultural history related to the river.  Prior to development of the railroad system in the late 1800s, the Cape Fear River was the primary artery of transportation for people and goods between Wilmington and points inland.  Both the Northington Ferry and a series of locks and dams were constructed on what is now park property.','12 miles of hiking trails on south side of park, 8 miles of bridle/hiking trails on north side.

Educational programs emphasize the importance of fire in maintaining this community type and illustrate how plants and animals have adapted to these conditions.  Interpretation of this theme is accomplished through slide talks, lectures, hikes, hands- on activities and on-site sampling.  The ecology of the Sandhills is the major focus of the preserve\'s Environmental Education Learning Experience (EELE) and museum. \r\n\r\nThe Longleaf Pine Forest\r\nWeymouth Woods contains some of the oldest longleaf pine trees remaining in the state.

General Assembly authorized a new state park in the scenic Hickory Nut Gorge area of western Rutherford and the surrounding counties of Polk, Henderson and Buncombe. Later that year, the first tract of land to form the state park was purchased. Since then many more acres have been added. The most notable was the 2007 transfer of Chimney Rock Park, a private nature park surrounding the striking 315-foot spire on the gorge\'s southern side, into the expanding park.\r\n\r\nThe daily services offered to visitors of the Chimney Rock Access of the state park are provided by a private contract managed by the Division of Parks and Recreation.  This section is open year round with the exception of Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Entry fees offset the cost of operating this popular tourist destination. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Chimney Rock and the Rumbling Bald Climbing Access are the only public accesses within Chimney Rock State Park. However, the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation will eventually develop other areas of the state park with facilities and recreation traditionally enjoyed in our Western North Carolina state parks.\r\n\r\nThe greater Chimney Rock State Park currently encompasses roughly 6,200 acres on both the north and south sides of the gorge and expansion efforts continue to bring more of the gorge\'s rich natural resources into conservation. \r\n\r\nChimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park has been a tourist destination in western North Carolina since a simple stairway was built to the rock\'s summit in 1885. In 1902, Lucius B. Morse of Missouri bought the site. The Morse family developed park facilities including a tunnel and elevator to the rock summit, nature center and a network of hiking trails to geologic points of interest including the 404-foot-tall Hickory Nut Falls.\r\n\r\nPlease click here to link to the site of Chimney Rock <a href=\"http://www.chimneyrockpark.com\">(www.chimneyrockpark.com)</a> to plan your exploration of one of North Carolina\'s most unusual natural wonders.\r\n\r\nThe park\'s master plan was recently completed.

General Assembly authorized a new state park in the scenic Hickory Nut Gorge area of western Rutherford and surrounding counties. The unit was designated as Chimney Rock State Park shortly after the state had acquired Chimney Rock Park, a private nature park surrounding the striking 315-foot spire on the gorge\'s southern side.  In 1902, Lucius B. Morse bought the site. The Morse family developed park facilities including a tunnel and elevator to the rock summit, a visitor center, nature center and a network of hiking trails to geologic points of interest and the 404-foot-tall Hickory Nut Falls.\r\n\r\nThe greater Chimney Rock State Park currently encompasses roughly 5,900 acres on both north and south sides of the gorge and expansion efforts continue to bring more of the gorge\'s rich natural resources into conservation. The primary sections of the park are Chimney Rock, World\'s Edge, and Rumbling Bald.  The addition of these lands to the State Parks System brings a large cluster of state and nationally significant sites, centered on the spectacular cliffs, rugged mountains, and unusually rich soils that line the gorge. With 36 rare plant species and 14 rare animal species, it is one of the major centers of biodiversity in the state.','Living on the Edge\r\nThe Rocky Broad River has cut through the mountainous terrain to create the 14-mile gorge.  This has created distinct geological features and a diversity of natural community types including low elevation rocky summit and low elevation granitic dome.  These areas are often too steep or rocky to support a closed forest canopy and many rare plant and animal species have adapted to such harsh environmental conditions.  The area\'s highest peaks and steep slopes host bird species relatively uncommon to the region.  Peregrine falcon and ravens prefer these rocky exposed cliffs to lay their eggs.  Rocky outcrops facing north also support unique plant species such as roundleaf serviceberry, Biltmore sedge, and eastern shooting star.  Life on these outcrops and cliff faces has teetered on the edge for many of these rare species, but with the continued protection of these incredible places they should be able to hang on.\r\n\r\nGeologic Forces Behind the Stunning Scenery of Hickory Nut Gorge\r\nThe magnificent cliffs at Chimney Rock State Park tell the story of nearly 500 million years of geologic forces.	These unhurried forces include ancient volcanic activity, heat and pressure miles beneath the earth\'s surface, plate tectonics and erosion. The area is still seismically active with a magnitude 3.1 earthquake 8 miles south of Lake Lure in 2007 and historical earthquake reports in the late 1800\'s giving Rumbling Bald its name. The Rocky Broad River carves a path 1,800 feet deep through the gorge, ending in man-made Lake Lure. On either side of the river, steep exposed cliffs underscore vegetated ridge tops, demonstrating two distinctly different types of bedrock. The forces of expanding ice between cracks in the cliffs and gravity cause large pieces of cliff to break off. These ongoing rockslides result in remarkable landforms including Chimney Rock, numerous caves and tunnels, and jagged cliff faces.','x','2016-10-27 18:21:02',46),('CHSW','','','','','Gates','36.401942','-76.904984','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','0','','','','','','2019-04-26 16:03:52',76),('CLNE','240 Park Entrance Road','','Seven Springs','28578','Wayne','35.2354','-77.8932','cliffs.neuse@ncparks.gov','(919) 778-6234','','','','(919) 778-7447','Park Hours:\r\nWinter (Dec., Jan., & Feb.): 7:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.\r\nSpring (March & April): 7:00 a.m.-9:00 p.m.    \r\nSummer (May-Sept.): 7:00 a.m.-10:00 p.m.\r\nFall (Oct. & Nov.): 7:00 a.m.-8:00 p.m.\r\n     \r\nVisitor Center: 9:00 a.m - 5:00 p.m. daily; including weekends; Visitor Center may be closed for one-hour at midday on weekends.

The mission of the state parks system is to conserve and protect representative examples of the natural beauty, ecological features and recreational resources of statewide significance; to provide outdoor recreational opportunities in a safe and healthy environment; and to provide environmental education opportunities that promote stewardship of the state\'s natural heritage. ','Cliffs of the Neuse State Park presently features a 35-site family campground (dump station for R.V. users/no electricity) and a four-site group campground (restrooms/no showers/shared water) for groups. The park\'s primary attraction during the summer season is its 11-acre swim lake and concession that are open daily Memorial Day-Labor Day for swimming and water activities(lifeguards on duty during season).  The park is presently about 1,100 acres in size and borders the Neuse River for about two miles.  Fishing is permitted in the river and anglers have good access at the base of the 350-yard Trail to target rockfish, shad, largemouth bass, bream or catfish depending upon the season.  The Visitor Center features natural and cultural displays and offers a 1,000 sq. ft. auditorium that is available for public and private organization use by fee.  Also featured is the park\'s 1800 sq. ft. picnic shelter (adjacent to restrooms) which may be reserved by fee also. Those with disabilities are permitted to drive to the picnic shelter upon request.  Weddings are permitted by reservation on the Swim Lake beach from Sept. 10-May. 10.','Cliffs of the Neuse State Park features two distinct forest types; bottomland bald cypress swamp adjacent to the Neuse River and upland longleaf pine forest that is augmented with a variety of hardwoods including southern red oak, scarlet oak, blackjack oak, sassafras, and mockernut hickory.  The forest was a historic home to species dependent upon longleaf pine including the red cockaded woodpecker and the eastern fox squirrel. Today, other wildlife typically found on the park include white-tailed deer, black bear, gray squirrels, eastern wild turkey, cottontail rabbit, barred owls, and eastern coyote.  Two venomous snakes, the eastern cottonmouth and the southern copperhead, are commonplace on the park in their respective habitats.\r\n         \r\nThe main geologic feature of the park is the multi-layered cliffs along the banks of the Neuse River just west of Seven Springs.  The steep, colorful cliffs are not only an important scenic resource; they are also a valuable educational resource that provides visitors with a view back through time.   Most of the exposed cliff layers belong to the Black Creek Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous period more than 66 million years ago. Park programs and museum exhibits demonstrate the geologic processes that formed the cliffs and how geologists and paleontologists observe landforms and fossils to create a picture of the geography, climate and life forms of the Cretaceous period.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the park features at least four different types of aquatic habitat: the Neuse River and its floodplain; two small creeks; one man-made lake, and a wetland bog area that was formerly known as Hickory Hill pond.  These different habitats represent a valuable educational resource for school groups and others to study water quality and related environmental issues.  The water quality issues within the Neuse River basin have been widely reported and are of interest to many park visitors.','Six hiking trails totaling nearly six miles.  Trails are easy to moderate in terms of difficulty.  Park staff regularly schedule paddle trail excursions on the Neuse River by canoe and kayak.  Canoe, kayak, peddle boat, and stand-up paddleboard rentals are available during the summer season (Mem.

All of this and more can be found just 3 miles south of the NC/VA border on US Hwy 17.     ','Formation of the Great Dismal Swamp\r\nThe basic hydrologic requirements for the formation and development of large peat swamps are a humid climate with reasonable uniform rainfall throughout the year, and restricted drainage, both surface and subsurface.  The thick, rather impervious clay which underlies the area is an effective seal, preventing either downward or upward movement of water.  These unique wetland conditions offer habitat to many distinct plant communities, black bears and over 150 species of birds. \r\n\r\nThe History of Human Activity in the Swamp\r\nThe commercial and agricultural values of the swamp were explored soon after it was discovered by Colonists, including draining the whole area by ditching.  The first canal, now called the Washington Ditch, was probably dug in the late 1760\'s to facilitate the harvesting and removal of the timber.  During the mid-1800\'s, hundreds of shingle flatboats, picturesque passenger ships and freighters plied its length.  This had a great effect on the Dismal Swamp as more and more timber was cut and shipped out via the canal and the numerous ditches cut for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRestoration of Natural Processes in the Swamp\r\nWhen the swamp was drained, the drier conditions allowed species such as maple and sweet gums to replace the Atlantic white cedar and cypress.  Fire suppression also appears to be detrimental to cedar and cypress.  A natural-resource management objective of the park is to help restore these natural forces.  Water control structures are being placed in some of the ditches to help restore the area\'s natural hydrology.  A prescribed burn program will benefit the area\'s native species.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',39),('EADI','345-B Park Entrance Rd.','','Seven Springs','28578','Wayne','','','','919-778-9488','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','The purpose statement for this park has not yet been entered.','','The interpretive themes for this park have not yet been entered.','','2020-04-02 20:45:38',45),('ELKN','5564 Meat Camp Road','','Todd','28684','Watauga, Ashe','36.332586','-81.69064','elk.knob@ncparks.gov','(828) 297-7261','','','','','Park Hours\r\nNovember - February, 7 a.m. - 6 p.m.\r\nMarch, April, May, September and October 7 a.m. - 8 p.m.\r\nJune - August 7 a.m. - 9 p.m.\r\nClosed Christmas Day\r\n\r\nPark Office Hours\r\n8 a.m. - 5 p.m. weekdays\r\nClosed state holidays','Elk Knob State Park is located in Watauga County approximately 9.5 miles north of Boone.\r\n\r\nTraveling north to Boone on US Highway 421, take NC 194 North approximately 4 miles and turn left onto Meat Camp Road.

The Eno River watershed is part of the Neuse River Basin, one of the most heavily populated river basins in North Carolina. As the populations in Durham and Orange counties continue to grow, humans affect water quality, water quantity, and aquatic life from the headwaters of the Eno River in Orange County all the way to the estuaries of the Pamlico Sound.  Interpretive programs focus on aquatic life and the importance of the interrelationships between flora, fauna, and humans to the health of the river ecosystem.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThe Eno River Valley has a rich human history, beginning with numerous Native American tribes that first settled the riverbanks to the more recent developments that threaten the river ecosystem.  Programs emphasize the settlement of the area from the 1750s to the early 1900s, while highlighting the milling community.  Mill sites, home sites, cemeteries, roads, fords, and signs of agriculture remain for park staff to interpret. Park staff tell the unique story of the park\'s creation, sharing how the Eno River Association formed to protect the river valley from development and how the Association continues to support the park through land acquisition and preservation.\r\n\r\nWildlife Habitat Conservation\r\nThe single greatest threat to habitats of the Eno River Valley is development.  As Orange and Durham counties continue to grow, land acquisition and management are critical.  The park provides crucial habitat -- food, water, shelter, and space -- for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by conserving riparian forests and mature upland forests.  Park programming covers the identification of habitats and their importance to the health of wildlife populations. \r\n\r\nGeologic Features\r\nThe metavolcanic rock lying under the water\'s surface and scattered about the valley tells the story of the Eno River\'s formation. Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area includes the highest point in Orange County at 867 feet and numerous rock outcrops demonstrating evidence of ancient volcanic activity.  The recent publication by the North Carolina Geologic Survey, A Geologic Adventure Along the Eno River, interprets the many geologic features found along the park\'s trails and is an invaluable resource for park staff and the public.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',4),('FALA','13304 Creedmoor Rd.','','Wake Forest','27587','Wake, Durham ','36.0117','-78.6888','falls.lake@ncparks.gov','(984) 867-8000','','','','(984) 867-8029','<u>Park Hours</u>rnrn<b>FOR SPECIFIC RECREATION AREA SEASONS OF OPERATION SEE \\\'CURRENT CONDITIONS\\\'</b>rnrn<b>Day Use Areas</b>rnrnNovember - February, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.rnMarch - April and September - October, 8 a.m. - 8 p.m.rnMay - August, 8 a.m. - 9 p.m.rnClosed Christmas Dayrnrn<b> Campgrounds</b>rnrnRollingview campground offers 24 hour access year round.

Singer Sewing Machine Company purchased the property and used it for logging purposes in the 1920\'s and 1930\'s.  Due to its steep topography and high levels of annual rainfall, the Gorges tract and surrounding lands offered potential for the development of hydro power projects.  This potential use enticed Duke Energy Corporation to purchase the property between 1940 and 1960.  In the late 1970\'s, Duke began conducting conservation studies and limiting access to the property to protect the environment.  Nearly 275 acres were placed on the North Carolina Registry of Natural Heritage Areas in 1982 due to the presence of numerous rare species.  By the late 1990\'s, Duke Energy had determined that it no longer needed large areas of the Gorges property and offered to sell the land to both North and South Carolina.  The State of North Carolina purchased 10,000 acres in Transylvania County in 1999 and established Gorges State Park and the adjacent Toxaway Game Land.\r\n\r\nA significant geologic feature from which the park derives its name, is the abundance of deep gorges created in part by a dramatic change in elevation of over 2,000 feet in a little over three miles.  This abrupt transition, combined with the high levels of annual rainfall and a large drainage area, produces an abundance of waterfalls that visitors seek and enjoy.  Gorges State Park is unique within the state parks system in that it straddles two major geologic provinces and the Brevard Fault Zone, which separates the two.  The Brevard Fault Zone, one of the major ancient fault zones of the Appalachians, contains unusual rock types such as mylonite and marble.  Mass slope movement features, such as the large slide on the east side of the Toxaway River, are evident.  In addition, many boulder and cobble deposits have been identified along an 8,000-foot reach of the Toxaway River, attributed to flooding that followed an earthen dam failure at Lake Toxaway during August of 1916.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional terrain and climate within Gorges State Park has made possible a rich and unusual assemblage of flora and fauna.  The large and unbroken natural landscape includes high quality examples of extensive natural communities such as Montane Oak-Hickory Forest, Chestnut Oak Forest, and Acidic Cove Forest, and widespread Pine-Oak/Health Forest, Rich Cove Forest and Spray Cliff Forest, uncommon natural communities, occur in small patches within the park.  The area contains a concentration of rare plants, such as Southern Oconee Bells (Shortia galacifolia var galacifolia), that is significant for the state and the entire southern Appalachians.  A particularly rich assortment of bryophytes and ferns, including a species more common to the tropical forests of Central America, is presumably owed to the high moisture and sheltered temperatures of the gorges.  The animal diversities of natural communities in the park are also high, and rare mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates are present.\r\n\r\nThe park\'s river and streams combine with topography to create a variety of scenic waterfalls that draw visitors to the park.  Powerful waterfalls plunging over rocky cliffs, falls shrouded in mist, cascading waters and riffles offer sights and sounds that are among the park\'s more significant features.  Higher up, ridge-top vistas extend for miles, offering panoramas of tree-blanketed slopes, rugged mountain ranges and lush vegetation.  Overlooks offer spectacular views of the surrounding natural landscape, with the view from the Bearwallow Valley observation deck stretching up to 20 miles into South Carolina on clear days.  Whether listening to the thunder of Bearwallow Falls, breathing in the rich, organic smells of the forests, or seeing the trees shimmer in a breeze along the mountainside, visitors find their time spent in the park to be both exhilarating and peaceful.\r\n\r\nGorges State Park offers many recreational opportunities that immerse visitors in its rich natural resources.  Diverse bird species, from breeding residents to neotopical migrants, lure both the amateur and serious bird-watcher.  Miles of trails offer hikers a range of experiences, Bearwallow Valley Over Look Trail tot he Upper Bearwallow Falls  trail conveniently accessed from teh Bearwallow  picnic area, to rugged overnight backpacking adventures deep within the park.  Some old roadbeds are sufficiently constructed to allow a mix of trail uses such as horseback riding and mountain biking.  Opportunities exist for  picnicking, primitive camping.  Fishing is permitted in the park\'s river and streams.  The park\'s large amount of undeveloped land and rugged terrain creates exceptional opportunities for visitors to experience wilderness.\r\n\r\nDespite the rugged topography that typifies this portion of North Carolina, the area encompassed by the park has a history of human use that covers several thousand years.  Archaeological investigations have documented numerous sites and features throughout the park.  These include pre-historic sites used by Indians, such as small hunting camps, as well as historic sites used by European settlers, such as homesteads and cemeteries.  The earliest pre-historic sites are believed to be up to 8,000 years in age, and sites established by Europeans date to the early 1700\'s.\r\n\r\nGorges State Park exists primarily so its outstanding geologic, biologic and scenic features can be protected, and also for its recreational and archaeological resources.  The Division of Parks and Recreation is charged with preserving these values and providing experiences within its units that promote pride in and understanding of the valuable natural heritage of North Carolina.  \r\n','Plunging waterfalls, rugged river gorges, sheer rock walls and one of the greatest concentrations of rare and unique species in the eastern United States are found within Gorges State Park. An elevation that rises 2,000 feet in only four miles, combined with rainfall in excess of 80 inches per year, creates a temperate rain forest and supports a collection of waterfalls.\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 1999, thanks to a unique partnership of industry, the environmental community and the state of North Carolina, 10,000 acres of the Jocassee Gorges in Transylvania County were placed in public ownership to be preserved for future generations of North Carolinians. The property was purchased by the state from Duke Energy Corporation, and the transaction created a 2,900-acre game land managed by the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. Currently, Gorges encompasses nearly 7,500 acres and is the only state park west of Asheville.\r\n\r\n','The Steep Terrain of the Blue Ridge Escarpment\r\nGorges State Park lies within the Blue Ridge Escarpment, a wide strip of steep, highly dissected land that drops sharply from the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the adjoining Piedmont lowlands.  In the park, the escarpment falls from its highest elevation of 3,200 feet to its lowest elevation of 1,200 feet in a distance of only four miles! The park is an ideal place to study geology. The escarpment includes many striking landforms such as large overhangs, cliffs, pavement outcrops, cascades and waterfalls. \r\n\r\nWet Climate and Abundant Surface Waters\r\nThe park is a very wet place, receiving an average of 80 to 90 inches of rainfall each year.  These rains supply the abundant surface waters, which are the main source of weathering and erosion in the park and throughout the Blue Ridge Escarpment.  The escarpment has the highest concentration of waterfalls and spray cliffs in eastern North America.  The wet gorges and spray cliffs host an amazing diversity of amphibians and tropical plants. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities and Rare Species\r\nBecause it is located in the transition zone between the Piedmont and mountains, the Blue Ridge Escarpment is a refuge for a diverse assortment of species and natural community types. The steep elevation gradient in the park creates differences in hydrology, soils and climate over very short distances, allowing for an ever-changing mosaic of natural communities. Unexpected combination of Piedmont and mountain species occur, and of the 114 natural community types found in North Carolina, 16 have been documented in the park.  These community types range from high-elevation hardwood forests to low-elevation cove forests, and include communities associated with waterfalls and spray cliffs.  The deep river gorges harbor an array of isolated species that are tropical in origin.  As a result, biologists refer to the escarpment as \"the tropics in the mountains\".','Grassy Ridge Access Area:  located in Sapphire, 0.7 miles south on Hwy-281s and is the location of the Visitor Center, Bearwallow and White Pines Picnic areas and the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.\r\n\r\nRainbow Falls Trail:  This strenuous 3.0-mile trail travels west out of Gorges State Park and into the Pisgah National Forest, is located at the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.

Towering nearly a vertical mile over the Piedmont, Grandfather has been recognized for centuries as a sentinel summit. In 1794, the mountain\'s dramatic views convinced the Botanist Andre Michaux that he\'d climbed \"the highest peak in all North America.\" From alpine-like vegetation and vistas on the highest peaks, to cascading streams far down in the foothills, more than a dozen distinct ecological zones stretch across the landscape. Seventy-plus species of rare, threatened and endangered plants and animals populate this rugged mountain, making it one of the East\'s most significant peaks; a United Nations International Biosphere Reserve. The park is known for some of the South\'s most severe weather and challenging hiking trails. Be preparedâ€”at times, hikers climb ladders up cliffs. Nature lovers and hikers alike find Grandfather Mountain to be a special, indeed globally significant place to encounter the outdoors. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, agreement was reached for the state parks system to acquire 2,456 acres of Grandfather Mountain to become North Carolinaâ€™s newest state park.

After traveling through the Intracoastal Waterway, the ferry moves through the shallow waters of Cow Channel, a channel through which cows were once herded to the island for grazing. The ferry then docks at the pier on Bear Island where a half-mile trail travels through the dune system, across the island, to the beach. This 15-minute walk is like a trip through the desert. The sand is often hot; wear protective shoes.\r\n\r\nThe park ferry operates daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day except in inclement weather. During popular summer months, a line often forms for the ferry and the island quickly reaches capacity. Arrive early in the day to avoid long delays.','NCDOT is expected to begin a paving project on Hammocks Beach Road around September 9, 2015. Please allow extra time when traveling to the park during this period.  Ferry Schedule for September is Wednesday through Sunday, hourly 9:30 until 4:30; no ferry service on Monday\'s or Tuesday\'s. No lifeguards on duty and concession stand closed for the remainder of the 2015 ferry season.','Ferry service to and from Bear Island operates during the month of September Wednesday through Sunday, hourly at the bottom of the hour from the mainland beginning at 9:30 am, and at the top of the hour from Bear Island with the last ferry leaving the island at 5:00 pm.  Lifeguards will not be on duty for the remainder of ferry season and the concession stand will be closed for the season as well. PLEASE bring any soft drinks and snacks with you to the island. Indoor showers on Bear Island are open to campers from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. each day, and drinking water, outdoor showers and restroom facilities are open daily. PLEASE use extreme caution in the water and be aware that dangerous rip currents can occur at any time. Contact the park office at hammocks.beach@ncparks.gov or 910.326.4881 with questions.\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE:  Pets, Carts and Wagons are not permitted on the ferry.  \r\n','Attention Campers:  The emergency phone system on Bear Island is currently out of service.  In the event of an emergency after hours please use your cell phone as cellular service from most carriers is available.','','2015-08-03 14:45:25','Venture to Bear Island and reward yourself with vivid memories of one of the most unspoiled beaches on the Atlantic coast.

Major concepts within this theme include the sea turtle\'s life history, migration routes, nesting requirements and behavior, reasons for endangerment, and park resource management efforts.  \r\n\r\nBarrier Island Ecology\r\nThis theme relates the dynamic geology of a barrier island to the associated flora and fauna that must adapt to it.  A cross-section of the island reveals different natural communities that have adapted to specific environmental conditions.   Some examples of these communities include upper beach, dune grass, salt marsh, and maritime forest.   The ways in which humans can affect barrier island ecology is an important concept within this theme.  \r\n\r\nLocal Cultural History\r\nThe third primary theme focuses on the cultural history of the area.   Topics under this theme include the use of Bear Island by Native Americans and pirates, as well as the role Bear Island played in the protection of the mainland during colonial times, the Civil War, and World War II.  This theme also includes the role of Dr. Sharpe, the Hursts, the NC Teachers Association, and the Hammocks Beach Corporation in the creation of Hammocks Beach State Park.  \r\n','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',10),('HARI','339 Conference Center Drive','','Browns Summit','27214','Rockingham, Guilford','36.250646','-79.756364','haw.river@ncparks.gov','(336) 342-6163','','','','(336) 342-0583','8am to 5pm Mon - Fri\r\nClosed most state holidays.  \r\nPlease call the park office to find out about extended hours for some weekends.

This facility is now operated as the division\'s first residential environmental education center and also provides conference facilities which can be rented for group activities.\r\n\r\nLocated near the headwaters of the Haw River, The Haw River State Park and Summit Environmental Education Center is situated on nearly 300 acres of piedmont forest, fields, wetlands, and uplands.\r\n\r\nAs land acquisition continues and Haw River State Park grows and develops the park will be able to provide additional resource protection of the Haw River Corridor and recreational opportunities for park visitors.  We hope to include picnicking, camping, and hiking opportunities in the future.  The Haw River Corridor is also a proposed route for the Mountains to Sea Trail.\r\n\r\nUntil additional properties are acquired for the state park, we do not have facilities for general public use.  Visitors are welcome to come to visit and see what we are all about, but it is recommended that you call ahead: our operating hours are Monday - Friday 8am to 5pm and we are closed most state holidays.  If the Summit is reserved for a weekend group, we will open during those reservation hours.

Human land use in the watershed affects the lake\'s water quality.  Agricultural land use and urban land use in the watershed contributes to storm water runoff, adding an excess of sediment and nutrients to the lake.  Programs in this theme area focus on aquatic life, water quality and water quantity.  The popular C.A.S.T. (Catch, A Sure Thing) program introduces children to fish biology, fish identification, fishing techniques and outdoor ethics. Other aquatic programs such as \"Pond Life\" give visitors a hands-on experience with the aquatic life in one of the ponds in the park.\r\n\r\nArea Wildlife: Predator-Prey \r\nIn addition to predator-prey relationships, this theme includes related ecological concepts such as food chain, food web, habitat, adaptation and resource management.   Most visitors explore predator-prey relationships through interpretive talks and nature hikes that focus on the bald eagle and other area wildlife.  Elementary students participate in activities from the EELE (Environmental Education Learning Experience), Predators and Prey, which emphasizes the bald eagle and its prey.  In both the EELE and interpretive programs, human impacts on food chains and animal habitats are discussed and stewardship is encouraged.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThis theme highlights the past human history of the New Hope River Valley.  Archaeologists have explored the remains of 450 prehistoric and historic sites in the area and have uncovered many Indian artifacts.  Scottish Highlanders settled the area in the 1740s.  Interpretive programs illustrate how various cultures used the natural resources of the upper Cape Fear River Basin. The park hosts Heritage Day on the first Saturday of October to celebrate the cultural history of the area.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',14),('JORI','300 W.

If you choose to paddle on sections that park staff have not removed trees from, be prepared to have to portage around or over many new trees across the river.  The wider sections of the river, such as through Lumberton, and from the Boardman access at US 74 down to the SC state line, and beyond, are some of the better options to boat without having to deal with possibly many trees across the river channel.

Add extra time for crossing exposed hazards and sandbars. All float times should include additional time to reach take-out points.','Water Quality of the Lumber River\r\nThe Lumber River is an excellent example of a Coastal Plain, blackwater river.  In 1989, it was designated by the General Assembly as a State River and, later, named as a National Wild and Scenic River.   Along with these designations comes the responsibility of the state and its citizens to maintain the excellent water quality of the river and its tributaries.  Educational programs within this theme emphasize stewardship and include major concepts such as watershed; river basin; water quality monitoring; water chemistry; sources of water pollution in the river basin; the dependence of aquatic life on water quality; and the relationship of water quality to the surrounding landforms, natural communities and human populations. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities within the Lumber River Corridor\r\nThe Lumber River\'s significant biological resources include the natural communities of the river, its floodplains and uplands.  Educational programs in this theme area focus on the communities of the river channel and backwaters; the communities of the bottomland, swamp and sandbar typical of most blackwater rivers; and the variety of upland communities within the proposed park river corridor.   Unusual upland communities, which add to the beauty and scenic character of the river, include the extremely dry, barren sand hills on relict sand dune deposits.  Many acres of uplands are fire dependent and must be managed with prescribed fire since natural fire regimes are no longer possible.  Ensuring that the public understands the role of prescribed fire in maintaining these communities is crucial to securing the position of prescribed fire as a management tool.  \r\n\r\nWater-based Recreation and Safety\r\nThe 102-mile-long Lumber River offers a variety of scenic resources as it meanders through North Carolina\'s Coastal Plain.   Many people enjoy canoeing, fishing and kayaking on the river as well as hiking and picnicking along its banks.  While providing these recreational opportunities to an expanding human population, we must also maintain the quality of the resource.  Educational programs in this theme area stress stewardship and aquatic safety.  Park staff helps visitors and others to enjoy the river in a responsible manner and to participate in its continued protection.  The CATCH (youth fishing) program and interpretive canoe hikes are popular educational programs in this theme area.','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',19),('MAIS','','','','','','34.135961','-77.850685','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','2019-04-05 18:05:56',75),('MARI','500 Old Mayo Park Road','','Mayodan','27027','Rockingham','36.438800','-79.938171','mayo.river@ncparks.gov','(336) 427-2530','','','','(336) 427-2650','November - February      8am-6pm\r\nMarch, April             8am-8pm\r\nSeptember, October       8am-8pm\r\nMay - August             8am-9pm\r\nClosed Christmas Day\r\n\r\nPark Office Hours\r\n8am-5pm weekdays\r\nClosed state holidays','Mayo River State Park\'s Mayo Mountain Access is located in western Rockingham County near the towns of Mayodan and Stoneville, 30 minutes north of Greensboro, N.C. and 20 minutes south of Martinsville, Va.

The story of the formation of the southern Appalachians through structural disturbance of the earth\'s crust will be depicted, along with the nature of present-day landform features.\r\n\r\nForest Decline\r\nThis theme includes explanations of how weather, soils, plants, animals and air pollution impact the spruce-fir forest on Mt. Mitchell.   It answers a frequently-asked question of park visitors: What is happening to the trees?  Scientists have yet to determine exactly what is responsible for the massive dying of Mount Mitchell\'s Fraser fir and red spruce trees.  Natural causes include insect damage, especially the balsam woolly adelgid; ice storms; high winds; drought; and the age of trees.  But natural factors alone are not sufficient explanation.  Research indicates a correlation between air pollution and forest decline.  In fact, four out of five days, Mt. Mitchell is covered in clouds and fog, sometimes as acidic as vinegar.  Subjected to such pollution, a healthy tree becomes weak and is unable to fight off natural stresses it could otherwise resist.\r\n\r\nBiological Islands in the Sky\r\nThis theme focuses on the unique plants and animals associated with the mountains in the southern Appalachians that are over 5,500 feet in elevation.  The spruce-fir forest on these high southern mountains forms islands in the sky, disjunct from each other and from those in southern Canada, which Mt. Mitchell\'s most closely resemble.','Trails: Choose between a short stroll or a long hike into the woods.\r\nHikers should wear appropriate clothing and carry proper gear as\r\nthe high altitude makes the climate of Mount Mitchell chilly, even\r\nin summer.

Students and other park visitors can participate the park\'s Environmental Education Learning Experience activities and interpretive programs that help them discover the composition geologic history of Raven Rock.  They can also explore the gravel terraces on higher ridges within the park that were deposited on top of the Raven Rock feature by the ancestral Cape Fear River.  And, they can observe how the modern Cape Fear River continues to sculpt and erode the rock today, such as at Fish Traps and Lanier Falls. \r\n\r\nThe Ecology of the Fall Zone\r\nAs a result of its unique position in the fall zone, the park harbors a remarkable diversity of natural communities and species. The park is located in Harnett County where the Piedmont, Sandhills and Coastal Plain come together.  Thus, ecological characteristics of all three regions are found within the park.  Of particular significance are examples of several natural communities, Piedmont/Mountain Levee Forest and remnant examples of Piedmont Longleaf Pine Forest. Interpretive programs, guided trail hikes and a self-guided nature trail allow park visitors to explore relationships between the geology and the fauna and flora, e.g., flat rocks, cliff faces, vernal pools, basic soils.  Visitors can also learn to recognize the natural communities that identify the Piedmont/Coastal Plain interface.\r\n\r\nNatural and Cultural History of the Cape Fear River\r\nVisitors learn about the natural and cultural history of the Cape Fear River.  The headwaters originate in the central and eastern Piedmont with a drainage basin about 3,400 square miles upstream from the park.  Bisected by the Cape Fear River, Raven Rock State Park provides an excellent location to study our state\'s largest river basin.  Visitors and students can explore several of the streams in the park that feed the river, test water quality and examine macro-invertebrates. The park has a rich cultural history related to the river.  Prior to development of the railroad system in the late 1800s, the Cape Fear River was the primary artery of transportation for people and goods between Wilmington and points inland.  Both the Northington Ferry and a series of locks and dams were constructed on what is now park property.','12 miles of hiking trails on south side of park, 8 miles of bridle/hiking trails on north side.

Educational programs emphasize the importance of fire in maintaining this community type and illustrate how plants and animals have adapted to these conditions.  Interpretation of this theme is accomplished through slide talks, lectures, hikes, hands- on activities and on-site sampling.  The ecology of the Sandhills is the major focus of the preserve\'s Environmental Education Learning Experience (EELE) and museum. \r\n\r\nThe Longleaf Pine Forest\r\nWeymouth Woods contains some of the oldest longleaf pine trees remaining in the state.  Park visitors learn about the life history, historical importance and environmental value of the native longleaf pine through slide talks, hikes, and hands-on activities from the preserve\'s EELE.  The park museum houses a new exhibit on the longleaf pine. \r\n\r\nFire Ecology\r\nLongleaf pine forests are natural communities adapted to periodic burning; their survival depends on fire.   Understandably, park visitors familiar with the \"Smokey the Bear\" message have many questions and concerns about the use of fire.  Through audio-visual programs, hikes, hands-on activities and museum exhibits, the staff conveys the importance of fire to the maintenance of the Sandhills ecosystem and describes the techniques used for conducting prescribed burns on the preserve.\r\n','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',34),('WHLA','','','Kelly','28448','Bladen','','','singletary.lake@ncparks.gov','(910) 669-2928','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','Yes','Sponaugle7857,Bernhardt3627,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Bernhardt3627,Bernhardt3627,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Laubisch9544,Howard6319,Johnson0989,Allen0989,Allen0989,Higgins6125,Allen0989,Allen0989,Ho','The purpose statement for this park has not yet been entered.','','','','2016-10-27 18:21:02',88),('WIGA','Wilderness Gateway State Trail','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','2017-05-17 21:00:50',85),('WIUM','8801 Glenwood Avenue','','Raleigh','27617','Wake','35.8905','-78.7502','william.umstead@ncparks.gov','(919) 571-4170','','','','(919) 571-4161','Park Hours\r\n\r\nThe gate at the Crabtree Creek entrance will open at 7 a.m. daily as part of a pilot program to allow early access to the trails system.

The addition of these lands to the State Parks System brings a large cluster of state and nationally significant sites, centered on the spectacular cliffs, rugged mountains, and unusually rich soils that line the gorge. With 36 rare plant species and 14 rare animal species, it is one of the major centers of biodiversity in the state.', 'Living on the Edge\r\nThe Rocky Broad River has cut through the mountainous terrain to create the 14-mile gorge.  This has created distinct geological features and a diversity of natural community types including low elevation rocky summit and low elevation granitic dome.  These areas are often too steep or rocky to support a closed forest canopy and many rare plant and animal species have adapted to such harsh environmental conditions.  The area\'s highest peaks and steep slopes host bird species relatively uncommon to the region.  Peregrine falcon and ravens prefer these rocky exposed cliffs to lay their eggs.  Rocky outcrops facing north also support unique plant species such as roundleaf serviceberry, Biltmore sedge, and eastern shooting star.  Life on these outcrops and cliff faces has teetered on the edge for many of these rare species, but with the continued protection of these incredible places they should be able to hang on.\r\n\r\nGeologic Forces Behind the Stunning Scenery of Hickory Nut Gorge\r\nThe magnificent cliffs at Chimney Rock State Park tell the story of nearly 500 million years of geologic forces.	These unhurried forces include ancient volcanic activity, heat and pressure miles beneath the earth\'s surface, plate tectonics and erosion. The area is still seismically active with a magnitude 3.1 earthquake 8 miles south of Lake Lure in 2007 and historical earthquake reports in the late 1800\'s giving Rumbling Bald its name. The Rocky Broad River carves a path 1,800 feet deep through the gorge, ending in man-made Lake Lure. On either side of the river, steep exposed cliffs underscore vegetated ridge tops, demonstrating two distinctly different types of bedrock. The forces of expanding ice between cracks in the cliffs and gravity cause large pieces of cliff to break off.

Most of the exposed cliff layers belong to the Black Creek Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous period more than 66 million years ago. Park programs and museum exhibits demonstrate the geologic processes that formed the cliffs and how geologists and paleontologists observe landforms and fossils to create a picture of the geography, climate and life forms of the Cretaceous period.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the park features at least four different types of aquatic habitat: the Neuse River and its floodplain; two small creeks; one man-made lake, and a wetland bog area that was formerly known as Hickory Hill pond.

', 'Formation of the Great Dismal Swamp\r\nThe basic hydrologic requirements for the formation and development of large peat swamps are a humid climate with reasonable uniform rainfall throughout the year, and restricted drainage, both surface and subsurface.  The thick, rather impervious clay which underlies the area is an effective seal, preventing either downward or upward movement of water.  These unique wetland conditions offer habitat to many distinct plant communities, black bears and over 150 species of birds. \r\n\r\nThe History of Human Activity in the Swamp\r\nThe commercial and agricultural values of the swamp were explored soon after it was discovered by Colonists, including draining the whole area by ditching.  The first canal, now called the Washington Ditch, was probably dug in the late 1760\'s to facilitate the harvesting and removal of the timber.  During the mid-1800\'s, hundreds of shingle flatboats, picturesque passenger ships and freighters plied its length.  This had a great effect on the Dismal Swamp as more and more timber was cut and shipped out via the canal and the numerous ditches cut for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRestoration of Natural Processes in the Swamp\r\nWhen the swamp was drained, the drier conditions allowed species such as maple and sweet gums to replace the Atlantic white cedar and cypress.  Fire suppression also appears to be detrimental to cedar and cypress.  A natural-resource management objective of the park is to help restore these natural forces.  Water control structures are being placed in some of the ditches to help restore the area\'s natural hydrology.  A prescribed burn program will benefit the area\'s native species.', '', '2016-10-27 18:21:02', 39),

The Eno River watershed is part of the Neuse River Basin, one of the most heavily populated river basins in North Carolina. As the populations in Durham and Orange counties continue to grow, humans affect water quality, water quantity, and aquatic life from the headwaters of the Eno River in Orange County all the way to the estuaries of the Pamlico Sound.  Interpretive programs focus on aquatic life and the importance of the interrelationships between flora, fauna, and humans to the health of the river ecosystem.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThe Eno River Valley has a rich human history, beginning with numerous Native American tribes that first settled the riverbanks to the more recent developments that threaten the river ecosystem.  Programs emphasize the settlement of the area from the 1750s to the early 1900s, while highlighting the milling community.  Mill sites, home sites, cemeteries, roads, fords, and signs of agriculture remain for park staff to interpret. Park staff tell the unique story of the park\'s creation, sharing how the Eno River Association formed to protect the river valley from development and how the Association continues to support the park through land acquisition and preservation.\r\n\r\nWildlife Habitat Conservation\r\nThe single greatest threat to habitats of the Eno River Valley is development.  As Orange and Durham counties continue to grow, land acquisition and management are critical.  The park provides crucial habitat -- food, water, shelter, and space -- for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by conserving riparian forests and mature upland forests.  Park programming covers the identification of habitats and their importance to the health of wildlife populations. \r\n\r\nGeologic Features\r\nThe metavolcanic rock lying under the water\'s surface and scattered about the valley tells the story of the Eno River\'s formation. Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area includes the highest point in Orange County at 867 feet and numerous rock outcrops demonstrating evidence of ancient volcanic activity.  The recent publication by the North Carolina Geologic Survey, A Geologic Adventure Along the Eno River, interprets the many geologic features found along the park\'s trails and is an invaluable resource for park staff and the public.', '', '2016-10-27 18:21:02', 4),

Singer Sewing Machine Company purchased the property and used it for logging purposes in the 1920\'s and 1930\'s.  Due to its steep topography and high levels of annual rainfall, the Gorges tract and surrounding lands offered potential for the development of hydro power projects.  This potential use enticed Duke Energy Corporation to purchase the property between 1940 and 1960.  In the late 1970\'s, Duke began conducting conservation studies and limiting access to the property to protect the environment.  Nearly 275 acres were placed on the North Carolina Registry of Natural Heritage Areas in 1982 due to the presence of numerous rare species.  By the late 1990\'s, Duke Energy had determined that it no longer needed large areas of the Gorges property and offered to sell the land to both North and South Carolina.  The State of North Carolina purchased 10,000 acres in Transylvania County in 1999 and established Gorges State Park and the adjacent Toxaway Game Land.\r\n\r\nA significant geologic feature from which the park derives its name, is the abundance of deep gorges created in part by a dramatic change in elevation of over 2,000 feet in a little over three miles.  This abrupt transition, combined with the high levels of annual rainfall and a large drainage area, produces an abundance of waterfalls that visitors seek and enjoy.  Gorges State Park is unique within the state parks system in that it straddles two major geologic provinces and the Brevard Fault Zone, which separates the two.  The Brevard Fault Zone, one of the major ancient fault zones of the Appalachians, contains unusual rock types such as mylonite and marble.  Mass slope movement features, such as the large slide on the east side of the Toxaway River, are evident.  In addition, many boulder and cobble deposits have been identified along an 8,000-foot reach of the Toxaway River, attributed to flooding that followed an earthen dam failure at Lake Toxaway during August of 1916.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional terrain and climate within Gorges State Park has made possible a rich and unusual assemblage of flora and fauna.  The large and unbroken natural landscape includes high quality examples of extensive natural communities such as Montane Oak-Hickory Forest, Chestnut Oak Forest, and Acidic Cove Forest, and widespread Pine-Oak/Health Forest, Rich Cove Forest and Spray Cliff Forest, uncommon natural communities, occur in small patches within the park.  The area contains a concentration of rare plants, such as Southern Oconee Bells (Shortia galacifolia var galacifolia), that is significant for the state and the entire southern Appalachians.  A particularly rich assortment of bryophytes and ferns, including a species more common to the tropical forests of Central America, is presumably owed to the high moisture and sheltered temperatures of the gorges.  The animal diversities of natural communities in the park are also high, and rare mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates are present.\r\n\r\nThe park\'s river and streams combine with topography to create a variety of scenic waterfalls that draw visitors to the park.  Powerful waterfalls plunging over rocky cliffs, falls shrouded in mist, cascading waters and riffles offer sights and sounds that are among the park\'s more significant features.  Higher up, ridge-top vistas extend for miles, offering panoramas of tree-blanketed slopes, rugged mountain ranges and lush vegetation.  Overlooks offer spectacular views of the surrounding natural landscape, with the view from the Bearwallow Valley observation deck stretching up to 20 miles into South Carolina on clear days.  Whether listening to the thunder of Bearwallow Falls, breathing in the rich, organic smells of the forests, or seeing the trees shimmer in a breeze along the mountainside, visitors find their time spent in the park to be both exhilarating and peaceful.\r\n\r\nGorges State Park offers many recreational opportunities that immerse visitors in its rich natural resources.  Diverse bird species, from breeding residents to neotopical migrants, lure both the amateur and serious bird-watcher.  Miles of trails offer hikers a range of experiences, Bearwallow Valley Over Look Trail tot he Upper Bearwallow Falls  trail conveniently accessed from teh Bearwallow  picnic area, to rugged overnight backpacking adventures deep within the park.  Some old roadbeds are sufficiently constructed to allow a mix of trail uses such as horseback riding and mountain biking.  Opportunities exist for  picnicking, primitive camping.  Fishing is permitted in the park\'s river and streams.  The park\'s large amount of undeveloped land and rugged terrain creates exceptional opportunities for visitors to experience wilderness.\r\n\r\nDespite the rugged topography that typifies this portion of North Carolina, the area encompassed by the park has a history of human use that covers several thousand years.  Archaeological investigations have documented numerous sites and features throughout the park.  These include pre-historic sites used by Indians, such as small hunting camps, as well as historic sites used by European settlers, such as homesteads and cemeteries.  The earliest pre-historic sites are believed to be up to 8,000 years in age, and sites established by Europeans date to the early 1700\'s.\r\n\r\nGorges State Park exists primarily so its outstanding geologic, biologic and scenic features can be protected, and also for its recreational and archaeological resources.  The Division of Parks and Recreation is charged with preserving these values and providing experiences within its units that promote pride in and understanding of the valuable natural heritage of North Carolina.  \r\n', 'Plunging waterfalls, rugged river gorges, sheer rock walls and one of the greatest concentrations of rare and unique species in the eastern United States are found within Gorges State Park.

In the park, the escarpment falls from its highest elevation of 3,200 feet to its lowest elevation of 1,200 feet in a distance of only four miles! The park is an ideal place to study geology. The escarpment includes many striking landforms such as large overhangs, cliffs, pavement outcrops, cascades and waterfalls. \r\n\r\nWet Climate and Abundant Surface Waters\r\nThe park is a very wet place, receiving an average of 80 to 90 inches of rainfall each year.  These rains supply the abundant surface waters, which are the main source of weathering and erosion in the park and throughout the Blue Ridge Escarpment.  The escarpment has the highest concentration of waterfalls and spray cliffs in eastern North America.  The wet gorges and spray cliffs host an amazing diversity of amphibians and tropical plants. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities and Rare Species\r\nBecause it is located in the transition zone between the Piedmont and mountains, the Blue Ridge Escarpment is a refuge for a diverse assortment of species and natural community types. The steep elevation gradient in the park creates differences in hydrology, soils and climate over very short distances, allowing for an ever-changing mosaic of natural communities. Unexpected combination of Piedmont and mountain species occur, and of the 114 natural community types found in North Carolina, 16 have been documented in the park.  These community types range from high-elevation hardwood forests to low-elevation cove forests, and include communities associated with waterfalls and spray cliffs.  The deep river gorges harbor an array of isolated species that are tropical in origin.  As a result, biologists refer to the escarpment as \"the tropics in the mountains\".', 'Grassy Ridge Access Area:  located in Sapphire, 0.7 miles south on Hwy-281s and is the location of the Visitor Center, Bearwallow and White Pines Picnic areas and the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.\r\n\r\nRainbow Falls Trail:  This strenuous 3.0-mile trail travels west out of Gorges State Park and into the Pisgah National Forest, is located at the Grassy Ridge Trailhead.

Seventy-plus species of rare, threatened and endangered plants and animals populate this rugged mountain, making it one of the East\'s most significant peaks; a United Nations International Biosphere Reserve.

We hope to include picnicking, camping, and hiking opportunities in the future.  The Haw River Corridor is also a proposed route for the Mountains to Sea Trail.\r\n\r\nUntil additional properties are acquired for the state park, we do not have facilities for general public use.  Visitors are welcome to come to visit and see what we are all about, but it is recommended that you call ahead: our operating hours are Monday - Friday 8am to 5pm and we are closed most state holidays.  If the Summit is reserved for a weekend group, we will open during those reservation hours.

Elementary students participate in activities from the EELE (Environmental Education Learning Experience), Predators and Prey, which emphasizes the bald eagle and its prey.  In both the EELE and interpretive programs, human impacts on food chains and animal habitats are discussed and stewardship is encouraged.\r\n\r\nCultural History\r\nThis theme highlights the past human history of the New Hope River Valley.

In 1989, it was designated by the General Assembly as a State River and, later, named as a National Wild and Scenic River.   Along with these designations comes the responsibility of the state and its citizens to maintain the excellent water quality of the river and its tributaries.  Educational programs within this theme emphasize stewardship and include major concepts such as watershed; river basin; water quality monitoring; water chemistry; sources of water pollution in the river basin; the dependence of aquatic life on water quality; and the relationship of water quality to the surrounding landforms, natural communities and human populations. \r\n\r\nNatural Communities within the Lumber River Corridor\r\nThe Lumber River\'s significant biological resources include the natural communities of the river, its floodplains and uplands.  Educational programs in this theme area focus on the communities of the river channel and backwaters; the communities of the bottomland, swamp and sandbar typical of most blackwater rivers; and the variety of upland communities within the proposed park river corridor.   Unusual upland communities, which add to the beauty and scenic character of the river, include the extremely dry, barren sand hills on relict sand dune deposits.  Many acres of uplands are fire dependent and must be managed with prescribed fire since natural fire regimes are no longer possible.  Ensuring that the public understands the role of prescribed fire in maintaining these communities is crucial to securing the position of prescribed fire as a management tool.  \r\n\r\nWater-based Recreation and Safety\r\nThe 102-mile-long Lumber River offers a variety of scenic resources as it meanders through North Carolina\'s Coastal Plain.   Many people enjoy canoeing, fishing and kayaking on the river as well as hiking and picnicking along its banks.  While providing these recreational opportunities to an expanding human population, we must also maintain the quality of the resource.  Educational programs in this theme area stress stewardship and aquatic safety.  Park staff helps visitors and others to enjoy the river in a responsible manner and to participate in its continued protection.  The CATCH (youth fishing) program and interpretive canoe hikes are popular educational programs in this theme area.', '', '2016-10-27 18:21:02', 19),

The story of the formation of the southern Appalachians through structural disturbance of the earth\'s crust will be depicted, along with the nature of present-day landform features.\r\n\r\nForest Decline\r\nThis theme includes explanations of how weather, soils, plants, animals and air pollution impact the spruce-fir forest on Mt. Mitchell.   It answers a frequently-asked question of park visitors: What is happening to the trees?  Scientists have yet to determine exactly what is responsible for the massive dying of Mount Mitchell\'s Fraser fir and red spruce trees.  Natural causes include insect damage, especially the balsam woolly adelgid; ice storms; high winds; drought; and the age of trees.  But natural factors alone are not sufficient explanation.  Research indicates a correlation between air pollution and forest decline.  In fact, four out of five days, Mt. Mitchell is covered in clouds and fog, sometimes as acidic as vinegar.  Subjected to such pollution, a healthy tree becomes weak and is unable to fight off natural stresses it could otherwise resist.\r\n\r\nBiological Islands in the Sky\r\nThis theme focuses on the unique plants and animals associated with the mountains in the southern Appalachians that are over 5,500 feet in elevation.  The spruce-fir forest on these high southern mountains forms islands in the sky, disjunct from each other and from those in southern Canada, which Mt. Mitchell\'s most closely resemble.', 'Trails: Choose between a short stroll or a long hike into the woods.\r\nHikers should wear appropriate clothing and carry proper gear as\r\nthe high altitude makes the climate of Mount Mitchell chilly, even\r\nin summer.

Students and other park visitors can participate the park\'s Environmental Education Learning Experience activities and interpretive programs that help them discover the composition geologic history of Raven Rock.  They can also explore the gravel terraces on higher ridges within the park that were deposited on top of the Raven Rock feature by the ancestral Cape Fear River.  And, they can observe how the modern Cape Fear River continues to sculpt and erode the rock today, such as at Fish Traps and Lanier Falls. \r\n\r\nThe Ecology of the Fall Zone\r\nAs a result of its unique position in the fall zone, the park harbors a remarkable diversity of natural communities and species. The park is located in Harnett County where the Piedmont, Sandhills and Coastal Plain come together.  Thus, ecological characteristics of all three regions are found within the park.  Of particular significance are examples of several natural communities, Piedmont/Mountain Levee Forest and remnant examples of Piedmont Longleaf Pine Forest. Interpretive programs, guided trail hikes and a self-guided nature trail allow park visitors to explore relationships between the geology and the fauna and flora, e.g., flat rocks, cliff faces, vernal pools, basic soils.  Visitors can also learn to recognize the natural communities that identify the Piedmont/Coastal Plain interface.\r\n\r\nNatural and Cultural History of the Cape Fear River\r\nVisitors learn about the natural and cultural history of the Cape Fear River.  The headwaters originate in the central and eastern Piedmont with a drainage basin about 3,400 square miles upstream from the park.  Bisected by the Cape Fear River, Raven Rock State Park provides an excellent location to study our state\'s largest river basin.  Visitors and students can explore several of the streams in the park that feed the river, test water quality and examine macro-invertebrates. The park has a rich cultural history related to the river.  Prior to development of the railroad system in the late 1800s, the Cape Fear River was the primary artery of transportation for people and goods between Wilmington and points inland.
