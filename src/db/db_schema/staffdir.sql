The members communicate the needs of the park to the community and region while representing the interests of the park?s visitors and neighbors to park managers.  As such, the committee is essentially a forum for discussion and a vehicle for communication and promotion of park needs.\r\n\r\nMembership on the State Park Advisory Committee will generally consist of seven members appointed by the Director of Parks and Recreation to staggered terms of three years.  To the extent possible, members selected will represent the interests of local government, user groups, education, business, conservation groups, senior citizens, and other park and recreation agencies.\r\n\r\nA State Park Advisory Committee has no final authority or responsibility for policy making or administrative control.  As the name implies, an advisory committee acts only in an advisory manner to the Park Superintendent and division management.  Though an advisory committee has no legal authority, it serves important functions in the interpretation of the park?s programs, facilities, services, and in studies and advocacy that help protect resources and enhance visitor services.\r\n\r\nAdvisory committees are most useful when their function and responsibility is clearly understood and practiced.  The committee should understand that they have no established legal status or authority, but are vitally important as liaison for improving the quality of life and leisure opportunities for their community, region and state.\r\n\r\nOrganizational Chart of the State Park Advisory Committee\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector/Deputy\r\nDivision of Parks & Recreation\r\n\r\nChief of Operations\r\n\r\nDistrict Superintendent\r\n\r\nPark Superintendent\r\n\r\nPark Staff \r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nState Parks Advisory\r\nCommittee\r\n\r\n\r\nState Park Advisory Committee/Operating Procedures\r\nPage Two\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE PARK ADVISORY COMMITTEE FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe primary function of an advisory committee is to advise and make recommendations to the Park Superintendent and Division Director.\r\n\r\nSome of the basic functions of the State Park Advisory Committee are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

To generally work toward a favorable public opinion of, and support for, state park resources and services through community, regional, and state groups.\r\n\r\n7.	To assist in matters relating to maintaining the highest standards of professional park and recreation leadership and in the quality of the programs offered by the park.\r\n\r\n8.

According to Lynn S. Rodney, University of Oregon, the success of an advisory board of a park and recreation department depends on the following four factors:\r\n\r\n1.	The advisory committee must maintain a clear-cut division of responsibilities between itself, its parent agency, and the professional staff.  The committee has the responsibility to advise the park superintendent on various policy matters that have been referred to them in regard to natural resource protection and the provision of park and recreation services.  It has no administrative authority or responsibility, making only general recommendations.\r\n\r\n2.	The advisory committee is responsible for advising on the basic policies that guide the state park.  The administration of the policy?the actual provision of the park and recreation service?is a technical problem that requires a technically trained staff.  This division-of-work principal serves the important and practical purpose of enabling the committee and staff to recognize their respective functions and to achieve the most effective working relationships to fulfill the State Parks and Recreation System?s mission.\r\n\r\n3.	The advisory committee must recognize that its recommendations will not always be followed but should not take this rejection personally.  Many times, proposals are rejected because of other factors not yet public knowledge.  However, with few exceptions, if the committee secures the pertinent facts of matters referred to it, deliberates carefully, and acts objectively, its recommendations will greatly influence policies for the development and operation of the park.\r\n\r\n4.	The advisory committee gives advice that the state park administration must evidence a willingness to consider, even though they are under no legal obligation to act on it.  Without such support, the committee becomes a mere observer, serving no useful purpose other than to ratify decisions already made.\r\n\r\nSTATE PARK ADVISORY COMMITTEE\r\nORIENTATION AND TRAINING\r\n\r\nTraining is important for advisory committee members to become competent members of the \r\nstate parks team.  Committee membership is a community trust.  Effective participation requires \r\norientation and training.  Included in this training program is the discussion of park operations \r\nand procedures with the committee members.\r\n State Park Advisory Committee/Operating Procedures\r\nPage Four\r\n\r\nRobert Artz, National Recreation and Park Association, suggests that the following basic \r\norientation information be provided to the committee members:\r\n\r\n1.	Legal provisions.\r\n\r\n	a.	The authority to operate; legal functions.\r\n\r\n	b.	State laws concerning conflict of interest.\r\n\r\n2.	Department policy statement, objectives, and history.\r\n\r\n3.	Functions of the Division of Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\n	a.	Rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n	b.	Organization, meetings, and committee.\r\n\r\n	c.	Advisory committee duties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n4.	Administrative organization.\r\n\r\n	a.	Powers and duties of the park superintendent.\r\n\r\n	b.	Organizational structure.\r\n\r\n	c.	Staff names and positions.\r\n\r\n5.	Established state park policies.\r\n\r\n	a.	Use of facilities.\r\n\r\n	b.	General fees and charges.\r\n\r\n	c.	Contributions; land and money.\r\n\r\n6.	State park operational information.\r\n\r\n	a.	Planning, development, guidelines, master plan standards.\r\n\r\n	b.	Financial structure; budget.\r\n\r\n	c.	Areas and facilities.\r\n\r\n	d.	Program, activities, special services.\r\n\r\n	e.	Public relations, annual reports, brochures, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Park Advisory Committee/Operating Procedures\r\nPage Five\r\n\r\nThe three major areas in which advisory committee members need continuous training are:\r\n\r\n1.	The activities and services provided by the park, including full up-to-date information and material on the organization and operation of the park.\r\n\r\n2.	The interests and behaviors of the community or area served by the park, including current facts on community goals, needs, resources, and how and where the park fits into the total community picture.\r\n\r\n3.	The functions of the advisory committee itself, including organization and operation, responsibilities, information and materials on the duties and responsibilities of individual members with guidelines to techniques to insure effective participation to achieve both the concept of committee teamwork, and a close partnership with the park superintendent and staff.\r\n\r\nRELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee Relationships with Staff and Local Interest Groups\r\n\r\nOne general purpose of a state park advisory committee is to create and maintain working agreements with the park, the Division of Parks and Recreation, other related community organizations, and the general public.\r\n\r\nIn relationship to the park:\r\n\r\n1.	Make periodic visits and observations of natural resources, areas and facilities to enhance professional operation, maintenance and management.\r\n\r\n2.	Make observations of all program activities and services (both scheduled and unscheduled visits).\r\n\r\n3.	Participate actively in the interpretation of the park?s services, objectives and needs.\r\n\r\nIn relationship to the park personnel:\r\n\r\n1.	Deal officially with the staff only through the park superintendent.\r\n\r\n2.	Invite members of the staff to meet with the committee when programs and problems relating to their responsibilities are under consideration.\r\n State Park Advisory Committee/Operating Procedures\r\nPage 6\r\n\r\nIn relationship to the Division of Parks and Recreation:\r\n\r\n1.	Familiarize themselves with division standards and policies.\r\n\r\n2.	Support the overall program of the division.  This illustrates to the general public that governing divisions are working together.\r\n\r\n3.	When making recommendations or decisions concerning the division, support all requests with written facts, oral communications, and action if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn relationship to other organizations and groups interested in state park and recreation services:\r\n\r\n1.	With the park superintendent, develop cooperative planning and programs with other public, voluntary, church, civic, business and educational agencies concerned with recreation, parks, conservation and leisure services.\r\n\r\n2.	Coordinate and cooperate with organized park user groups to insure effective planning of total visitor services along with adequate protection of the park?s natural resources.\r\n\r\nFinally, in relationship to the public:\r\n\r\n1.	Take the initiative in forming community and regional task forces when needed, bringing together on occasion informal groups representing people concerned with park and recreation services, for a discussion of mutual problems and as an aid in cooperative planning and issue resolution.\r\n\r\n2.	Welcome suggestions and constructive criticism from the general public and assure them that they will receive thoughtful consideration and appropriate action when warranted.\r\n\r\n3.	Conduct affairs in a manner that wins public respect and support for the park and the division.\r\n\r\n4.	Be responsive, responsible, and representative of the interests of the entire community.\r\n\r\n BY-LAWS GOVERNING\r\nTHE\r\nSTATE PARK ADVISORY COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nADOPTED  				\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1:\r\n\r\n	a.

Other spaces may be added to this list as new facilities are built. Park Superintendents and District Superintendents will identify such spaces and recommend additions to this list, along with suggested additional charges, to the Superintendent of State ParKs and the Director for their review and approval. Also, spaces may be recommended for deletion from this list by the Park Superintendent and the District Superintendent to the Superintendent of State Parks and the Director if operational, situational, or other changes warrant such a deletion.\r\nIn order for the Division of Parks and Recreation to retain priority use of these facilities for the primary purposes for which they were designed, applications for Special Activity Permits for these spaces will generally be accepted no more than 30 days in advance. To allow for review and processing time, applications should be received at least 48 hours in advance. Multiple days of use will not, as a rule, be permitted. Permit fees and additional charges are due wh<:m permits are issued. Cancellation of use and requests for refund must be made in writing no later than 24 hours prior to intended use. A five dollar ($5.00) refund fee will be deducted from the amount to be refunded.\r\nSpecial Activity Permits are not generally required for meetings, classes, and related activities that involve park or other division staff, or other state, local, or federal agencies or non-profit organizations with cooperative working relationships with the park. Any other state, local, federal, non-profit, or for-profit agencies or organizations will require a permit and will be charged a permit fee and additional charges unless waived by the Director. These spaces are not available for commercial or fund raising activities and compatible use determinations will be made by the Park Superintendent on a case-by-case basis. All park rules and regulations apply, and no food or beverages are allowed in these facilities without prior approval by the Superintendent. All indoor facilities are smoke free spaces. Other more specific provisions and conditions may apply, depending on the park and the facility.\r\nThe recipient of a Special Activity Permit assumes all responsibility for liability during and as a result of the permitted special activity. Facility capacity use numbers will be specified on the Special Activity Permit, along with any other special conditions or provisions by the permit.

While the State Personnel Manual does not contain a policy on work breaks, it has been common practice to allow a break of ten to fifteen minutes in the morning and afternoon.  Effective immediately it will be the policy of the division to allow one fifteen minute break in the morning and one fifteen minute break in the afternoon when workload and time permit.  Decisions concerning the appropriateness and timing of specific breaks will be made by the supervisor. \r\n\r\nIf you feel you must smoke and cannot adhere to the length of time between breaks then you must arrange with your supervisor to schedule no more than three (3) five minute breaks in the morning and no more than three (3) five minute breaks in the afternoon.

This sections reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n?It shall be the policy of this State to conserve and protect its lands and waters for the benefit of all its citizenry, and to this end it shall be a proper function of the State of North Carolina and its political subdivisions to acquire and preserve park, recreation, and scenic areas, to control and limit the pollution of our air and water, to control and limit excessive noise, and in every other appropriate way to preserve as a part of the common heritage of this state its forests, wetlands, estuaries, beaches, historical sites, open land and places of beauty.?\r\n\r\nThe State Parks Act [G.S. 113-44.8] states:\r\n\r\n?The State of North Carolina offers unique archaeologic, geologic, biological, scenic, and recreational resources.  These resources are part of the heritage of the people of the State.  The heritage of a people should be preserved and managed by those people for their use and for the use of their visitors and descendants.?\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina State Parks System plays an important role in maintaining, rehabilitating, and perpetuating the State?s natural heritage.  The natural resources of the State Parks System are: native plants and animals; geologic features and landforms; water resources; high quality, rare or representative examples of natural communities; and the natural processes that affect these elements.  The primary objective in natural resource management will be the protection of natural resources for their inherent integrity and for appropriate types of enjoyment while ensuring their availability to future generations.\r\n\r\nPOLICY\r\n\r\nPreservation of significant resources shall have priority in the management of park resources.  Natural resources will be managed by allowing natural environments to evolve through natural processes with minimal influence from human activities.  Division managers will try to maintain all of the components and processes of naturally evolving ecosystems.  They will not attempt solely to preserve individual species or individual processes.  When intervention is necessary, under the circumstances stated below, direct or secondary effects on park resources will be minimized to the greatest extent possible.\r\n\r\nIntervention with natural processes may occur:\r\n\r\n1) to correct or compensate for the disruption of natural processes caused by human activities;\r\n2) to protect, restore, or enhance Rare Species and Natural Communities;\r\n3) to protect, restore, or enhance significant archaeological resources;\r\n4) to construct, maintain, improve or protect park facilities;\r\n5) to prevent danger to human health and safety around park facilities.\r\n\r\nAll park facilities will be designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid direct and indirect adverse impacts to high quality natural communities, rare plant and animal species, major archaeological sites, and other significant natural and cultural resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nNatural community - \r\nis ?a distinct and reoccurring assemblage of populations of plants, animals, bacteria and fungi naturally associated with each other and their physical environment.?  Natural community characteristics and functions are shaped by the process of evolution and ecological interactions over long periods of time without the overriding influences of modern human activities. \r\nRare Species - \r\nare plant and animal species listed by the Natural Heritage Program as Endangered, Threatened, Special Concern, Candidate, or Significantly Rare.  Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern plant and animal species have legal protection status from the North Carolina Plant Protection Program and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, respectively. \r\n\r\nPlants\r\nEndangered ? Any species of plant whose continued existence as a viable component of the state?s flora is in jeopardy.\r\nThreatened ? Any species of plant likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future.\r\nSpecial Concern ? Any species of plant which requires population monitoring, but which may be collected and sold under specific regulations.\r\nCandidate ? Any species for which there is not evidence of declining numbers or threats to the species in North Carolina, but which, because of small numbers of populations, rare habitat, or distribution, may become threatened in the future; or a species suspected of being endangered or threatened, but for which sufficient information is not currently available to support such a status specification.\r\nSignificantly Rare ? Any other species which has not been listed as Endangered, Threatened, Special Concern or Candidate species, but which has been determined to need monitoring by the Natural Heritage Program.\r\n\r\nAnimals\r\nEndangered ? Any native or once-native species of wild animal whose continued existence as a viable component of the State?s fauna is determined by the Wildlife Resources Commission to be in jeopardy or any species of wild animal determined to be an ?endangered species? pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. \r\nThreatened ? Any native or once-native species of wild animal which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range, or one that is designated as a threatened species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.\r\nSpecial Concern ? Any species of wild animal native once-native to North Carolina, which is determined by the Wildlife Resources Commission to require monitoring but which may be taken under regulations adopted under the provisions of Article 25 of Chapter 113 of the General Statues.\r\nSignificantly Rare ? Any other species which has not been listed as Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern species, but which exists in the state in small numbers and has been determined to need monitoring by the Natural Heritage Program.\r\n\r\nNatural processes ? \r\nare physical events and biological interactions which are not the result of human activities.  Natural processes include but are not limited to weather, erosion, natural fire regimes, plant succession, native insect infestation, migration, disease, and populations fluctuations.\r\n\r\nSignificant archaeological resources - \r\nare ?any material remains of past human life or activities which are at least 50 years old and which are of archaeological interest including pieces of pottery, basketry, bottles, weapons, weapon projectiles, tools, structures or portions of structures, rock paintings, rock carvings, intaglios, graves or human skeletal material?. \r\n\r\nNative plants and animals - \r\nare plant and animal species of a park that, as a result of natural processes, occur or occurred on the land or in the waters of that park.\r\n\r\nFacilities - \r\nare developed recreational sites including, but not limited to, public access roads, trails, park offices and visitor centers, maintenance areas, picnic areas, tent and trailer campgrounds, and boat ramps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

POLICY\r\nThe Division\'s Law Enforcement Guideline, Program Direction, Section 1.1.3 sets forth division policy regarding the role of the law enforcement program. Commissioned staff should emphasize a basic educational approach in every enforcement contact where it is possible and reasonable to do so. The Division\'s objective is to gain compliance at the lowest possible level of enforcement action.\r\nLevels of enforcement action range from mere officer presence up to and including the use of deadly force. Commissioned staff are trained in the appropriate use of a wide spectrum of enforcement actions generally referred to as the \"force continuum\", (ref. L. E. Guideline, Section 8.1.2, Use of Defensive Equipment). Aerosol chemical agents represent a non-lethal defensive weapon that is placed on the low to middle range of the force continuum.\r\nTbe Division issues oleoresin capsicum (O.C.) Spray to qualified commissioned staff as an optional chemical agent. Only commissioned staffwho have been trained in the use of O.C. Spray, including experiencing the effects of the spray, are authorized to carry it.\r\ni \\\'\"\r\nII. DEFINITION\r\nA Oleoresin Capsicum Spray is an organically based, less-than-lethal weapon designed to incapacitate without lasting aftereffects. Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.) Is a mixture of essential oil and a resin found in any solanaceous plant of the genus capsicum, such as cayenne pepper, which is a natural product listed in many foodstuffs. O.C. spray may be referred to as pepper mace or pepper gas.\r\nB. O.C. spray is a personal defense spray that disables a suspect by causing severe irritation of the eyes, throat and upper respiratory tract. This product can create spasms and involuntary closing of the eyes, coughing, gasping and shortness of breath similar to a severe astluna attack. These effects may last up to 45 minutes.\r\nill. DEPARTMENTALLY-APPROVED SPRAY\r\nA An officer shall only possess and use O.C. spray approved and issued by\r\n	the Division.\r\ni \\,\r\n--\r\n \r\n\r\nOleoresin Capsicum Spray Policy\r\nAppendix 0\r\nB. Issued O.C. spray will be carried on the equipment belt in.a holster approved and\r\n	issued by the Division.\r\nIV. TRAJNING\r\nA. Each officer must receive training prior to being issued the product.\r\nB. The training will be delivered in the following format:\r\n1.	Classroom instruction and practical exercise provided by an\r\ninstructor who has received tra#llng from a manufacturer ofO.C. spray or and instructor recognized as appropriate by the North Carolina Justice Academy, North Carolina Department of Justice.\r\n2.	The training will be delivered in a four-hour block of instruction\r\nwhich includes lecture and practical exercise including\r\ndecontamination. .\r\n3.	The classroom instruction will include the following topical areas:\r\na.	History of Oleoresin Capsicum Spray\r\nb.	Product Components	.\r\nc. Physiological Effects ofO.C. spray d. Use of Force (Continuum)\r\ne.	Proper Deployment ofO.C. spray\r\nf	Decontamination Procedures\r\ng.	Documentation of Use of Spray\r\n4.	A written examination will be given to each officer with regard to\r\n	the above mentioned topics.\r\nS.	Each officer will be required to participate in a practical exercise in\r\nwhich they will be sprayed with a one (1) second burst ofO.C. in order to receive the effects of the spray. In addition, each officer will assist in the decontamination procedures used on the participants who have been sprayed.\r\nV.	ANTICIPATED REACTIONS OF SUBJECTS EXPOSED TO O.C. SPRAY\r\nA. The effects ofO.C. spray are usually instantaneous; however, the effects to the eyes usually precede the effects to the respiratory or skin areas.\r\n \r\n\r\nOleoresin Capsicum Spray Policy\r\nAppendix 0\r\n((\r\nB. When a subject is surprised with an application ofO.C. spray, he/she will often gasp in surprise, thus inhaling additional amounts of spray into the lungs. This will result in a broader range of field-observed effects ftom those observed and experienced in the classroom training exercise.\r\nC. Generally, the subject experiencing O.C.. spray exposure may:\r\n1.	Drop to both knees and fall onto their chest. [A forward moving\r\nsubject still operating on inertia must be avoided. The officer must be prepared to deflect and/or sidestep the subject that has been sprayed. ]\r\n2.	drop whatever is in hislher hands~\r\n3. bend forward at th waist;\r\n4.	put his/her hands to his/her face~ or\r\n5.	place his/her hands on the knees or will go down on one knee.\r\nD.\r\nThe officer should note at this point that the subject is reaching to the O.C. spray and he/she should be ordered into a prone or tlatwall position for handcuffing. The officer should reassure the subject that he/she will be treated and that the effects will wear off shortly.\r\nVI. GUIDELINES FOR USAGE\r\nA The officer may use O.C. spray in situations where physical force is authorized by law and Division policy. In particular, O.C. spray may be used:\r\n1.	where the officer\'s presence and verbal cominands are ineffective or\r\n	inappropriate~ or\r\n2.	where soft hand techniques (light touching, escort techniques) have\r\nfailed and the officer may be required to use hard hand techniques to maintain control, or where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe soft hands techniques will not succeed or will expose the officer to physical assault by the subject.\r\n((\r\n\",\r\n- - ---\r\n--\r\n \r\n\r\nOleoresin Capsicum Spray Policy\r\nAppendix 0\r\nB. An officer may use the O.C. spray under any other circumstances where it is reasonably necessary to effect an arrest, prevent an escape, or protect the officer, the arrestee, or another ftom injury. When practical, O.C. spray should be used in place of striking the subject with a fist or weapon in order to avoid injury to the subject and the officer.\r\nC. O.C. spray shall be used in accordance with prescribed training procedures. An officer shall not engage in horseplay with O.C. spray. The spray shall not be used to quiet a verbally abusive subject, to punish a subject, as part of interrogation of a subject, or against a subject who peacefully complies with orders and conimands.\r\nvn. PROCEDURES\r\nA An officer should disengage ftom a subject, when possible, prior to drawing the O.C. spray. The effective range of the O.C. canister is 8 to 12 feet.\r\nB. Once the O.C. canister is drawn, the officer, when possible, should give a verbal warning to the subject prior to the use of the spray. Example: \"Stop resisting. Get down on the ground, or I\'ll spray you with pepper.\" This warning is recommended if a warning can be given without risk of injury to the officer.\r\nC. The target area for the spraying ofO.C. is the bridge of the nose.\r\nD. An officer should utilize a spray pattern consistent with approved training\r\n	and adequate for the circumstances.\r\nE. A one-second spraying onto the facial area of a person will usuallv produce effective results. Additional spraying may be required if the person remains aggressive and does not respond to verbal commands.\r\nF. After t~e subject has been sprayed, he/she should assure the subject that he/she will be treated and that the effects will dissipate shortly. The officer will first handcuff and then search the subject.\r\nvrn. DECONTAMINATION\r\nA Officers must pay strict attention to the physical condition of a prisoner after using pepper spray. Immediate medical attention should be provided if breathing difficulties persist after 2 minutes or the prisoner loses consciousness, appears sick, or sweats profusely.\r\n-\r\n \r\n\r\nOleoresin Capsicum Spray Policy\r\nAppendix 0\r\nB. When circumstances permit, the officer should wait a period of fifteen (15) minutes before transporting the subject to allow natural evaporation to reduce the effects of the O.C. spray in the patrol car. During this fifteen (15) minutes, the officer should handcuff and search the subject. The officer will also decontaminate the subject at he scene of the arrest when an officer\'s safety is not jeopardized.\r\nC. After handcuffing and searching the subject, an officer should instruct the subject to stay still, not to rub his/her eyes, breathe normally, and relax as much as possible.\r\nD. An officer should move the subject into an uncontaminated area as soon as\r\n	possible and face the subject into the wind.\r\nE.	Prior to transporting the subject and when safety permits, an officer will\r\nutilize an appropriate spray bottle and spray water only into the subject\'s face and eyes. The subject\'s face may be patted dry with paper towels.\r\nF.	While transporting the subject, an officer shall provide ventilation to the\r\nsubject by opening the window and/or directing the air conditioning vent toward the subject\'s face.\r\nG. Upon arrival, an officer shall allow th~ subject to flush his face and eyes with cool water. A non oil-based soap or detergent can be used and will help remove the resin from the skin.\r\nH. Do not use anv commercial eye wash during the decontamination process.\r\nI.	Subjects wearing contact lenses should remove them before flushing the\r\n	eyes with water and soak the lenses with appropriate cleaning solutions.\r\nJ.	Under normal circumstances, all symptoms should disappear within forth\r\nfive (45) minutes. If symptoms persist beyond forth-five (45) minutes, an officer must seek medical attention for the subject. If the subject requests medical attention after the flushing of the eyes and face, an officer shall .\r\nassist the subject in obtaining medical attention.\r\nIX.

Motor Fleet Management (MFM) regulations require that, ?persons who will be driving a state-owned motor vehicle must have a valid driver?s license and must show the license prior to obtaining a vehicle. All persons responsible for agency-assigned MFM vehicles are required by legislation to photocopy the driver?s license of all persons who operate the vehicle and to retain these photocopies on file. Whenever drivers have six or more points on their license, MFM will notify the agency that the driver?s agency will be held financially responsible for accidents by the driver.?\r\n \r\nTo ensure compliance with the NCGS and MFM regulations, all Division parks, district offices and program sections must maintain a driver?s license photocopy on file of all employees that drive State-owned vehicles. Employees must maintain a current and appropriate driver?s license for the type of vehicle they are assigned to operate. This would include all vehicles owned by the Division, MFM or any other vehicle being operated on official business for the Division of Parks and Recreation. Supervisors are responsible for verification of an employee?s driver?s license before an employee is allowed to start work on their first day of employment. \r\n\r\nEach park, district office and program section shall maintain a file with a copy of the driver?s license of all employees, permanent and temporary, who may operate a motor vehicle while in the performance of their job duties. This file will be kept secure at that park/section office or in a designated secure location for that section.  This file must be audited at least once a year with a physical verification of each employee?s driver?s license.  All current employees shall provide an updated license if the current one on file is expired or missing.  It is the employees? responsibility to notify their supervisor of any change in the status of their driver?s license. \r\n\r\nFor clarification or questions you may have concerning this directive, please contact the Division Safety Officer. \r\n\r\nLRL/YK\r\n', 'LRL/YK', '', '', ''),

Sign should be placed within the driver?s cone-of-vision, within forty feet of the road?s edge.\r\n\r\n2. Sign should be perpendicular to approaching viewer or at an angle not greater than 20%.\r\n\r\n3. Signs should be placed on the right side of the roadway whenever possible.  A divided entrance with the sign in the middle of two lanes should be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\n4. Avoid placement of sign on steep slopes or where severe grade changes are required.\r\n\r\n5. Lighting should be of the general area in which the sign is located rather than on the sign itself.\r\n\r\n6. Domestic landscaping will not be used around signs. When landscaping is required, plantings will consist of materials native to the park area.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.     Sign Materials and Aesthetics\r\n	\r\n1. Sign materials will vary with location but can include stone, brick, or wood used in similar fashion as on existing buildings in the park or typical of local conditions.\r\n\r\n2. In general, signs will be made of pressure treated wood with routed letters, on a masonry base typical of local conditions.  If masonry materials are not common in area, use wood posts or other appropriate materials.\r\n\r\n3. Stain will be used to tone the sign wood and a reflective ivory paint will be used in the routed letters.  The stain color will comply with the Staff Directive on park colors.\r\n\r\n4. Use metal angle iron to support the main park sign in all locations.  Do not imbed masonry.  At coastal parks, avoid metal parts if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPark Entrance Sign Design Guideline\r\nPage 2\r\nApril 30, 1993\r\n\r\n\r\nC.     Size and Style of Lettering\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Sign letters should be routed using the traditional ?Blue Ridge? style letter.  The routed depth should be at least _? deep.  Eventually a master set of letters in the 8? and 4? sizes will be available from the Planning and Development Section.\r\n\r\n2. The sign should contain only the name of the park and the name of the division.  Words like ?entrance? and ?welcome? are extraneous and unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. The name of the department changes too frequently to be placed on this sign.\r\n\r\n4. All letters will be capitalized.\r\n\r\n5. The sign will have three lines of print.\r\n\r\na. Line one will be on the name of the park, in 8? letters, centered on the sign board.\r\n\r\nb. Line two will be the words, STATE PARK, centered on the sign board, in 8? letters.\r\n\r\nc. Line three will be the words, DIVISION OF PARKS AND RECREATION, centered on the board, in 4? letters.\r\n\r\nd. A minimum of 6? will be between the upper and lower lines of type and any edge of the sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.    Sign Proportions and Shape\r\n\r\n1. In general the center wooden portion of the sign will be approximately 5? by 10?.\r\n\r\n2. The mass units at each end of the sign of masonry will be piers approximately 3? X 3? X 60?.  If these elements of the sign are of other materials, they will also conform to this proportion as near as practical.\r\n\r\n3. Height of end piers will be determined by final site location and lay of the land.\r\n\r\n4. The two end piers may be connected by a common base of the same material if desired or required by method of sign board attachment.\r\n\r\n5. The upper edge of the wooden sign may be shaped to reflect the parks major feature  (see example).  This is optional and may only be effective on signs at parks with distinctive land form. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPark Entrance Sign Design Guideline\r\nPage 3\r\nApril 30, 1993\r\n\r\nE.    Sign Maintenance\r\n\r\n1. Missing, broken or vandalized signs reflect on the park?s image and portray an attitude of neglect which, in turn, can lead to further abuse of an area and encourage vandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

This law requires the collection of newspaper, aluminum cans, glass containers, and plastic beverage containers at picnic areas and concessions areas at six pilot parks until June 30, 1993.\r\n\r\nWaynesborough, Umstead, Hanging Rock, Falls Lake, Jockey?s Ridge and Duke Power are designated as pilot parks.  A plan for implementation of a recycling program, along with the necessary reporting form, are attached.\r\n\r\nOther parks are encouraged to participate in recycling to the extent possible.  All other parks will submit the attached annual recycling report.', 'PKM/jas', 'NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION OF PARKS AND RECREATION\r\n\r\nPILOT RECYCLING PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nI.	Pilot Parks ? Minimum Number of Sites\r\n\r\n		Waynesborough		1		Picnic Area\r\n		Wm. B. Umstead		3		One at Each Picnic Area\r\n		Hanging Rock			3		One at Each Picnic Area\r\n								One at Concession Area\r\n		Falls Lake			5		One at Highway 50\r\n								Two at Rollingview Picnic Area\r\n								Two at Sandling Beach Picnic Area\r\n		Jockey?s Ridge		1		Picnic Area\r\n		Duke Power			3		One at Each Picnic Area\r\n								One at Concession Area\r\n\r\nAdditional sites can be placed within the park at the park superintendent?s discretion.\r\n\r\nII.	Collection Bins\r\n\r\nA.	Some parks may be able to obtain collection bins from the local county waste disposal program.\r\n\r\nB.	Some parks may be able to obtain collection bins from local commercial recycling companies.\r\n\r\nC.	Some parks will need to construct collection bins.  A covered trash can rack with four well-labeled standard trash cans is recommended.\r\n\r\nThe decision on the type of collection bin will be made based on availability, cost, and site constraints and will be made by the individual superintendent at each pilot park.\r\n\r\nIII.	Labor\r\n\r\nNo additional funds are provided to the Division for the implementation of the pilot recycling program.  Park superintendents are encouraged to explore the use of volunteer labor and donated resources where possible.  Park support groups, local environmental organizations, civic clubs, or scout groups may be willing to donate or construct collection bins.  A group may also consider emptying the bins, sorting the materials, and transporting the recycleables to local collection sites as a project or fund raiser, thereby eliminating all cost to the park.\r\n\r\nIV.	Funds Received\r\n\r\nA.	Some parks can dispose of recyclables at local county collection sites near the park.  In this case, no funds would be received.\r\nPilot Recycling Proposal\r\nPage Two\r\n\r\n\r\nB.	Some parks may have local recycling businesses willing to supply collection bins and empty them as needed.  In this case, no funds would be received, but there would be no cost or little cost to the Division.\r\n\r\nC.	Some parks may have local recycling businesses that would buy all or some of the recyclables.  In this case, all funds collected will be deposited to 0998 Miscellaneous Receipts.\r\n\r\nBecause of labor and transportation costs, the sale of recycled materials will really be cost effective.  The decision on disposition of recycled material will be made on available choices and total cost to the park, and will be made by the individual superintendent at each pilot park.\r\n\r\nIV.	Report\r\n\r\n	The law requires a report of the results and recommendation on the pilot program on or before February 1, 1993, and an interim report on or before February 1, 1992.  There is no information in the law on what should be contained in the Division report.\r\n\r\n	Two forms have been developed to aid in the compiling of information for a report.  Division Recycling Tracking Form 002 and Annual Recycling Report 001 (copy attached).  Pilot parks will record recycling results on the recycling tracking report.  The tracking form will be retained in the park and be used to compile information for the Annual Recycling Report.  The Annual Recycling Report will be completed by each pilot park and submitted to the Chief of Operations on January 1, 1992 and January 1, 1993.  The Chief of Operations will develop a Division report by combining information provided from the pilot park report and submit to the Deputy Director on or before January 5 of each year.\r\n\r\nV.	Non-Pilot Parks\r\n\r\n	Many parks now have in place a recycling program of varying degrees.  All parks will be encouraged to participate in recycling to the extent possible.  Only pilot parks will be required to collect all four identified items at all picnic and concession areas.  All parks will be required to submit the annual report on January 1, 1992 and January 1, 1993 through the appropriate district superintendent to the Chief of Operations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nRECLY FORM 002										YEAR___________\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA DIVISION OF PARKS AND RECREATION\r\nRECYCLING TRACKING REPORT\r\n\r\nDATE	TRANSP COST	LABOR COST	MATERIAL	WEIGHT (LBS)	RECEIPTS\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\nA = ALUMINUM	P = PLASTIC		G = GLASS		NP = NEWSPAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE______________\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nRECLY FORM 001\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA DIVISION OF PARKS AND RECREATION\r\nANNUAL RECYCLING REPORT\r\n\r\n1.

Therefore, it is the responsibility of each supervisor to adhere to the following guidelines in insuring compliance with NRCD Division of Personnel policies and continuation of Division hiring authorization.\r\n\r\nESTABLISHING POSITIONS\r\n\r\n	The NRCD Division of Personnel will retain the responsibility for classification and pay level.  The procedure for establishing, classifying and extending positions will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n	The Division of Parks and Recreation will submit a T-1 form to establish each new temporary labor/seasonal position.  The T-1 will be sent to Budget and Management for verification of funds and then forwarded to NRCD Personnel.\r\n\r\n	NRCD Personnel will evaluate, classify and assign a title, salary grade, and position number which will establish a permanent record.  This will normally be within one week from the date received in NRCD Personnel.  If NRCD Personnel increases the rate above that proposed, availability of funds will be verified.  The T-1 will be rerouted through Budget and Management for reverification of funds.\r\n\r\n	NRCD Personnel will then send approved copies of the T-1 forms to Budget and Management and the Division of Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\n	Requests for extensions of positions will be submitted to Budget and Management on a T-2 form approximately 30 days prior to the original termination date for the position.  Budget and management will verify the availability for temporary salary funds and forward the T-2 to Personnel.\r\n\r\n	Seasonal positions have already been established but any new seasonal positions will be established as outlined above.\r\n\r\n \r\nStaff Directive 86-1\r\nPage 2\r\n\r\nRECRUITMENT AND SELECTION\r\n\r\n	The Park Superintendent will advertise all positions with the Employment Security Commission for an application period of not less than seven workdays.  After a position is listed with ESC, the local office with which the listing is made shall be notified by the Park Superintendent within 15 days after the position is filled.  Colleges, universities and other available sources will also be notified of position vacancies.  Though not required, temporary positions may be listed on the NRCD vacancy list.\r\n\r\n	The DP&R will then screen and interview a minimum of three applicants per position and using an internal recommendation processing form, make recommendation to the Park Superintendent for approval to hire (sample attached).  In the case where the Park Superintendent does the interviewing, he is authorized to hire but will be monitored by the Division.  It is of utmost importance to keep accurate records of applicants who apply and for what position in order to adequately defend the hiring process in the event of a grievance or EEOC charge.  The Park Superintendent is responsible for this hiring process.  A copy of the recommendation form and original applications shall be retained for two years by the Park Superintendent.\r\n\r\n	The original recommendation form along with copy of each application will be submitted to DP&R Personnel to monitor affirmative action efforts, make reports to NRCD Personnel and file.\r\n\r\n	The DP&R will be responsible for developing affirmative action goals and recruitment of minorities in order to meet those goals.  If all recruitment efforts fail to get minority applicants, a detailed explanation must be submitted to substantiate all efforts made.  Affirmative action reports on applicants and new hires will be due on a monthly basis to DP&R Personnel.  Reports from all parks will be combined to make a Division report to NRCD Personnel.\r\n\r\n	The DP&R is delegated the authority to hire and terminate temporary employment; however, termination for cause (dismissal) is to be discussed with DP&R for procedures.  An oral warning or suspension may be necessary procedure prior to termination.  The DP&R Director will be responsible for Step 1 grievances.  NRCD Division of Personnel is responsible for any grievance beyond Step 1.\r\n\r\nPAYROLL\r\n\r\n	The DP&R will submit a new W-4 form with the first payroll that the employee appears on.\r\n\r\n	The position number assigned by the Division of Personnel will be placed on the payroll in the space to the right of the block for the social security number.  Any employee, new or old, that does not have an assigned position number has been determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF SERVICE\r\n\r\n	No temporary employee may be on payroll for more than 12 consecutive months without a break in service.  Following each break in service, he/she may return for another twelve months of service provided the position has sufficient funding and has been so identified.\r\nStaff Directive 86-1\r\nPage 3\r\n\r\n	A break in service is defined as thirty-one consecutive calendar days off payroll or the numerical equivalent (see note).\r\n\r\n		NOTE:\r\n		\r\nThe numerical equivalent to a 31-calendar-day break in service is defined as an employee working less than 1,896 hours in a 12-month period.  The 1,896 hours is calculated as 2,080 hours (52 weeks x 40 hours) minus 184 hours (23 workdays x 8 hours; 23 being the maximum number of 8-hour workdays in 31 calendar days).  This will permit positions that cannot be justified as permanent to be used for longer periods of time without forcing financial hardship on employees via a one-month unbroken break in service.\r\n\r\nSALARY ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n	Temporary employees will normally be paid at the hiring rate for the salary grade assigned to the position.  Any deviation from this policy must be justified on the recommendation form and approved by NRCD Personnel.\r\n\r\n	At such time as the freeze on raises is lifted, recurring temporary employees who have accumulated an aggregate of twelve months of service may be considered for a performance increase at the beginning of their next period of employment.  Increases will be based upon performance of duties and must be approved by the Personnel Director.  Request for performance increases must be submitted on T-3 forms.\r\n\r\n	If the increase is approved, the Division will receive authorization on the T-3 form.  The T-3 form should be attached to the appropriate payroll.\r\n\r\n	Temporary employees will not receive performance salary increases during their period of employment.  They may be considered for promotional increase during their period of employment if they move to another position of a higher salary grade.\r\n\r\n	In years when legislative increases are granted to permanent employees, temporary employees? salaries will be increased to the new salary schedule effective October 1.\r\n\r\nMONITORING\r\n\r\n	The NRCD Division of Personnel will monitor affirmative action and temporary hiring of the DP&R to maintain effectiveness and viability in the temporary employment system as well as provide technical assistance and guidance in implementing and maintaining the system.\r\n\r\n', '', '', 'SD1997-13,', ''),

Davis, Director', 'Revised Procedures for Additions or Modifications to Division Work Plan', 'Plans become useless when they become outdated or are incapable of changing to meet new conditions or situations.  The Division work plan is important to our being able to justify our workload and helpful to every employee in knowing how she or he relates to the job to be done.  Over the past several months, we have all worked very hard to prepare a comprehensive work plan based on a conceptual framework of how we shall manage the Division.\r\n\r\nWe must now put into place a mechanism for revising existing work elements, or adding new work elements to the work plan.  Therefore, the following process shall be utilized by anyone wishing to revise, delete, or add work elements to the work plan.\r\n\r\nThis Directive updates and supercedes Staff Directive 85-14 by adding a new form to add or change element and subelements in the computer tracking system.\r\n\r\n	Step 1.  Develop the logic.  The proposer should list in their correct order the individual job steps which make up the project.  Do not be concerned with how long the jobs will take nor who, or what, is needed to complete them.  The steps are to be listed on Attachment One.\r\n\r\n	Step Two.  Develop a Networking Chart.  Once all of the activities necessary to complete the job have been identified, a graphical representation of how the job steps need to be completed is prepared and this involves the construction of a network.  Jobs will be arranged in their correct sequence, and how they depend upon each other will be shown.\r\n\r\n	Step Three.  Timings.	The next step is the estimation of the duration of each job.  Place this information against the job description in the proper blank on Attachment Two and against the representation of each job on the network.  For example of how a networking chart is completed, see Illustration One.\r\n\r\n	Step Four.  Analysis.	The network is analyzed to determine the start and end time in man hours.  Additionally, the critical path is determined.  In any project, there is one sequence of jobs that is longer than any other and this determines how long the project will take.  The network must identify what the critical path is for the work element and illustrate this by use \r\n \r\nStaff Directive 86-3\r\nPage 2\r\n\r\nof a dashed line connecting the sequence of blocks on the network which requires the greatest number of man hours.\r\n\r\n	Step Five.  Scheduling.  The proposer will identify a ?must have? date for the work element and show it on Attachment Two.  The proposer will take that date and, using the estimates already prepared, back out days to show a ?must start by? date.  This is accomplished by using the critical path.  Last, the proposer must identify the resources necessary to accomplish the project, whether it be fiscal or manpower, and show the work element steps where those resources are required.  This is done on Attachment Two.\r\n\r\n	Step Six.  Determine Mandate.  The proposer shall identify the legislative mandate for the work element and attach a copy of pertinent sections to the package, as shown on Attachment Three.  In addition, a tie-in to the SCORP Action Plan must be shown.\r\n\r\n	Step Seven.  Complete Input/Change Form.	The proposer shall complete the attached Element and Subelement Input/Change Form.  The form is used to provide data input for the computer tracking system.\r\n\r\n	Step Eight.  Review and Approval.  Once the entire package is complete, the proposer will submit it to the Division?s senior management, which consists of the Director, Deputy Director, and Section Chiefs.  This group will make a recommendation to the Director after reviewing the proposal.  If the work element is accepted, it is sent to a technical advisory group for more detailed refining.  It is then returned to the Director for his scheduling.  It is expected that the proposer shall present the work element package in person to the senior staff at a meeting called for this purpose and he will be expected to defend and justify the proposal.\r\n\r\n	The directive is in effect until further notice.

In essence, a forty hour cap or ceiling is being established.  Again, supervisors are responsible for insuring that employees under their charge comply with this component.\r\n\r\n	The purpose of this directive is twofold.

McKnelly, Director\r\nSUBJECT:	Secondary and Dual Employment Policy and Procedure\r\nThis directive replaces Staff Directive 85-5.\r\nThe Department policy and procedures on secondary employment are attached and follow the policy of the Office of State Personnel on secondary and dual employment (sections 4 and 7 of the State Personnel Manual).\r\nIf you wish to become engaged in secondary or dual employment, you must complete the attached ?Request for Approval of Secondary/Dual Employment? form and submit it through your supervisor for approval before beginning employment.\r\nApprovals shall remain in effect for the time specified on the application as the expected period of employment.  The expected period of employment must be a specific date and not an indefinite length of time.  This process must be repeated any time there is a significant change in the conditions of either primary or secondary employment.\r\n?Request for Approval of Secondary/Dual Employment? forms are to be routed though the supervisory chain of command for processing.

PERSONNEL\r\nSECTION 16  ?  SECONDARY EMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\n.100	PURPOSE\r\n	The goals of secondary employment procedures are:\r\n\r\n	.1	To avoid potential conflicts between the primary job responsibilities of an EHNR employee and responsibilities that might arise out of other employment.\r\n\r\n	2.	To establish the process by which approval of secondary employment may be obtained and to set forth the criteria that will be applied to determine whether approval is given.\r\n\r\n.200	POLICY\r\n	All employees of EHNR must comply with the policies and procedures contained herein prior to undertaking any secondary employment.  While employees are generally free to use their nonwork hours as they desire, public employees incur certain limited restrictions on outside employment that are necessary to protect the public interest.  Therefore, no secondary employment will be allowed if it is in conflict with the employee?s primary job responsibilities or if it would impair the employee?s ability to carry out his/her primary job responsibilities.\r\n\r\n	.1	Conflict of Interest.  Secondary employment shall be approved only if the value of services provided by the employee would reasonably appear to be independent of the employee?s association with the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources.  Additionally, the following prohibitions shall be observed:\r\n\r\na)	Activities wherein an employee could enrich either himself/herself or his/her secondary employer by resort to privileged information or specialized knowledge about EHNR policy, programs, regulations, procedures, litigation, or intended actions.\r\n\r\nb)	Activities that make it difficult for the public to discern whether the employee is engaged in primary employment or secondary employment.\r\n\r\nc)	Compensation through secondary employment for services that ought to be provided as a part of primary employment responsibilities.\r\n\r\nd)	Use of state equipment, materials, or facilities in the furtherance of secondary employment activity.\r\n\r\n	This rule does not prevent employees from working in secondary jobs where their employment with EHNR gives them no labor market advantage over persons with similar skills who are unassociated with the Department.\r\n\r\n	.2  Impairment of Work Performance.  Employees shall avoid secondary employment that would impair their ability to perform their job with EHNR.\r\n\r\na)	Employees shall not engage in any activity that will impair the physical stamina and mental attentiveness necessary to perform their primary employment.  Hours, stress, physical strain, and travel required for the secondary and primary jobs will be considered along with prior productivity, when making this determination.\r\n\r\nb)	Employees shall not engage in secondary employment during their EHNR work hours.\r\n\r\n.300	DEFINITIONS\r\n	SECONDARY EMPLOYMENT  is work for compensation from any source except EHNR or another state agency.  This includes self-employment and ownership of businesses.  It includes pay by salary, wages, commissions, sales income, goods, services, travel benefits, room, board or anything else of value.  Work for another state agency is ?dual employment? and is covered by other state policies.  The employee?s EHNR job is considered his/her ?primary employment?\r\n\r\n	Examples of secondary employment include, but are not limited to: consulting in any field; sales work; clerical services; commercial fishing; farming; Christmas tree farming; selling real estate or acting as a broker; investment advice; repair work; landscaping or design services; surveying; appraisals; paid church work; selling firewood; expert testimony for reimbursement (other than as part of state employment).\r\n\r\n	Examples of incoming producing and other work which is not considered secondary employment include, but are not limited to: investment of personally owned assets in stocks, bonds, real estate, or timber; sale of the employee?s own assets; or service in a military reserve organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is any question as to whether a given activity constitutes secondary employment, it is the responsibility of the employee to bring the question to appropriate department personnel for resolution of the question.\r\n\r\n.400	PROCEDURES\r\n	Written departmental approval must be secured prior to the beginning of any secondary employment.  Failure to secure this approval shall be considered a personal conduct violation subjecting the employee to immediate disciplinary action, which could include dismissal.  All new employees must apply for approval to continue secondary employment within sixty days of start of employment or cease secondary employment before the end of that period.\r\n\r\n	Approval shall be granted only on forms provided by the Department.  This application for approval shall be filed with the employee?s immediate supervisor and shall be acted upon by the Department within 30 days of filing.  For good cause, the immediate supervisor may grant temporary approval of secondary employment while the request for departmental approval is being processed, provided that such temporary approval may not exceed 30 days.  The original request of final Department decisions shall be maintained by the Division of Personnel, with a copy mailed to the employee.\r\n\r\n	Secondary employment must be approved by the Secretary or the Secretary?s designee.  Approvals shall remain in effect for the period specified at the time of application as the expected period of employment; provided, however, that approvals shall become invalid upon a significant material change in the conditions of either primary or secondary employment.\r\n\r\n	The Secretary may revoke approval of secondary employment at any time for just cause.\r\n\r\n	Any adverse impacts of secondary employment shall be considered by supervisors during the annual employee performance review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nState of North Carolina\r\nDepartment of Environment, Health and Natural Resources\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF SECONDARY EMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\n							DATE:  _____________________________\r\n\r\n1.

Intensive recreation activities, such as camping, can cause tree damage by altering the tree?s natural environment, or by directly damaging roots, stems and branches.  These changes can lead to the development of hazardous trees, which pose a safety risk for park visitors to recreation sites.\r\n\r\nThe park staff is in the unenviable position of trying to preserve a recreation site?s natural setting while trying to provide reasonable public safety by identifying and then correcting hazardous trees.  Some tree failures can be predicted on the basis of identifiable defects; some failures cannot be predicted.  There will be failures during severe storms that have nothing to do with tree defects.  There are significant unknown or undetectable interactions occurring within forest and shade tree communities that may result in hazard trees. \r\n\r\nAll hazardous trees cannot be detected, corrected or eliminated.  However, the park staff implementing a hazard tree management program can help make a recreation site reasonably safe while preserving its natural setting.  This guideline will provide the framework for a hazard tree management program, which consists of regular and systematic inspections based on readily identifiable tree defects. \r\n\r\nWhat is a hazard tree?  A hazard tree is defined as any defective tree, or tree part, that poses a high risk upon failure to cause injury to people or damage to property.  A hazard tree has one or more defects, which decreases its structural integrity and gives it an increased potential for failure.  Defects that are visible or detectable include cracks, decayed wood, weak branch unions, cankers, poor tree architecture, root problems and dead trees or branches.  \r\n\r\nA defective tree is not considered hazardous unless there is a nearby target that it could hit.  A target could be a person, vehicle, tent, building, picnic table, campfire ring, recreation equipment and etc.  The term target area is used to describe an area where people or their equipment, are likely to stop and congregate.  An individual campsite is an example of a target area.\r\nBy definition, a hazard tree = a defective tree plus a target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 2.0Page: 4Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 	GUIDELINE RESPONSIBILITIES\r\n\r\n	Division Director\r\nThe division director is responsible to ensure the overall development and administration of the Hazardous Tree Guideline.\r\n\r\n	Superintendent of State Parks\r\nThe superintendent of state parks is responsible for the management and supervision of the Hazardous Tree Guideline and to ensure compliance throughout the division.\r\n\r\n	Division Safety Officer\r\nThe division safety officer is responsible for the administration of the Hazardous Tree Guideline.

Inspections, maintenance and corrective action will accomplish this goal.\r\n\r\nOn an annual basis trees in the following areas will be inspected:  drive-in campsites, hike-in campsites, group camps, picnic areas, around buildings and facilities in developed campgrounds, hiking trails/bridal trails, public water accesses, administrative sites, roadways and parking lot peripheries. \r\n\r\nNot covered by this policy are trees along trout streams, abandoned forest roads, and natural forest areas not generally used by park visitors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 6Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0	 	INSPECTIONS\r\n\r\nAn inspection is a systematic method of examining and rating trees.  The purpose of a hazard tree inspection is to detect defective trees in target areas, assesses the severity of the defects and recommend\r\n corrective action before tree failure occurs.  \r\n\r\nThe first step of an inspection is to decide which areas should be inspected.  In general inspection priorities are based upon human mobility within the target area, the duration of site occupancy and the level of site maintenance.  \r\n\r\nThe second step is to choose appropriate personnel to perform the inspections.  Park personnel (inspector = Ranger/Maintenance) assigned to this task should be familiar with tree species found on site, tree defects and their potential for failure.  \r\n\r\nAt the discretion of the park superintendent, one of the following inspection methods should be used:\r\n\r\n4.1	Individual Tree Inspection\r\nEach tree in the specified area or any tree that could reach the target area will receive a 360-degree visual inspection for flaws and viewed from bottom to top.  The designated inspector can make the final decision for corrective action.  On occasion the inspector will have to confer with the park superintendent for guidance on how to handle a sensitive or technically difficult situation.  This type of inspection will be standard for high-risk areas. (See table 4.1 for high and low risk areas)\r\n\r\n4.2	Walk Through Inspection\r\nWalk through the area visually scanning for potential flaws.  This includes inspections of individual trees suspected of being hazardous, as above.  Walk through inspections are standard for low risk areas. \r\n\r\nUse of binoculars, wood chisels, hammers, coring devices, and other tools enhance the quality of the inspection process.  Areas are best inspected prior to peak visitation times.  Inspections should be conducted to allow sufficient time to schedule necessary work.  Areas should remain closed until hazardous tree conditions are eliminated.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 7Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nInspections can be done any time of the year.  The best time to see structural defects is during the leaf-off season.  Early spring and late autumn when visitor are few would work well.  Inspections done during leaf-on seasons, give a better sense of tree condition and location of dead branches.  \r\n\r\nIf construction or severe storm occurred since the last inspection, then additional inspection should be done.  As soon as possible after a severe storm a thorough inspection of high-risk areas and intensively used areas should be done to find trees and branches that failed, fractured or developed a lean during the storm. Strong winds can take a minor defect and change into a major one that may require corrective action.  \r\n\r\nWhen the inspector (s) arrive at the site they must determine which trees to inspect.  Not all trees need to be inspected.  Only trees that could fall onto a target or into the target area need to be inspected.  The target area will vary according to facility type, see table 4.2.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to inspect each individual tree for defects.  During the inspection the severity of each tree?s defects are judged with respect to defect levels established in section 5.0 (Assessment).  The final step of the inspection is to provide documentation.  Use the inspection form located in the appendix along with a PR-63.  A separate inspection form should be used for each facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n					            See table 4.2 for target area.\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 8Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4.1 High and Low Risk Areas\r\n	\r\nFacility Type	High Risk	Low Risk\r\nDrive-in campsite	X	\r\nHike-in campsite	X	\r\nGroup camps	X	\r\nPicnic areas	X	\r\nRestroom facilities	X	\r\nHiking trails		X\r\nHorse bridle trails		X\r\nPublic water accesses		X\r\nRoadways		X\r\nParking lot peripheries		X\r\nAdministrative office sites		X\r\n\r\nTable 4.2 Target Areas\r\n\r\nFacility Type	Target Area\r\nDrive-in campsite	Target area will vary from park to park based on campground layout.

The field examinations must be conducted in a careful and systematic manner.  The search for defects in individual trees is a time consuming and repetitive process, so allow plenty of time for inspections.  Individual tree evaluations must include a close inspection of the rooting zone, root flares, main stem, branches and branch unions.  Use a pair of binoculars to visually inspect the higher branches.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors should be considered while evaluating individual trees.  These factors include but are not limited to; potential targets, target area, the presence of cracks and other defects, tree species, tree age and size, and tree condition.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 13Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	Potential Target and Target Area\r\nDefective trees are not hazard trees unless there is a target.  If the defective tree in question would fail at the groundline, fall and not reach the target/target area, it is not considered a hazard tree since it poses no serious threat.  Targets may be campsites, parking lots, picnic areas, buildings, public water accesses, or anywhere people are likely to congregate and/or stop. \r\n\r\nCracks\r\nCracks are a principle factor in hazard tree evaluation.  A crack is a fissure or deep split in the wood.  Cracks are the visible sign that tree failure has begun and that corrective action is necessary.\r\n\r\nDefects(s) Present\r\nDefects are visible signals that a tree is failing or has the potential to fail.  There are seven main categories of defects: cracks, weak branch unions, stem or branch decay, cankers, dead trees and branches, root problems and poor tree architecture.  \r\nDefects affect the structural integrity of the tree.  Each type of defect has a range of severity; from no action required to requiring more immediate action.  Often trees will have more than one defect.   \r\n\r\nTree Species\r\nThe type of defect a tree has is often influenced by the species of the tree.  Some species are more prone to failure from certain kinds of defects.  Silver Maples tend to form codominant stems and thus form weak branch unions.  Learn the common defects known to trouble the tree species in your area and actively search for those defects.  \r\n\r\nTree Age and Size\r\nThe majority of serious defects are found in old and/or large trees.  This is because old trees have had time to accumulate injuries and infections and more time for the problems to develop into structural defects.  Large trees have greater structural stresses due to their size and weight.  Defects identified and corrected in younger trees may reduce future hazards as they grow in age and size.\r\n\r\nTree Condition\r\nDetermining tree condition involves evaluating the overall health and vigor of the tree.  Trees in good condition will have live full crowns, few dead branches and full-sized foliage on actively growing branches.  Trees in poor condition or declining trees will have branches dying back as well as many dead branches, with smaller and off-colored foliage.  Declining trees have a higher probability of branch failures and premature death. \r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 14Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0	ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nA sound tree becomes potentially hazardous when the trees woody structure is weakened by defects.  Most defects can be linked to past wounding, pest infestations or severe storms that fracture, destroyed or decayed the wood.  Defects are visible signs that a tree has failed, is failing or has the potential to fail.  These are the seven main categories of defects:\r\n\r\nCracks\r\nWeak branch unions\r\nStem or branch decay\r\nCankers\r\nDead trees, tops or branches\r\nRoot problems\r\nPoor tree architecture\r\n\r\nCracks are the most serious defect because they indicate that the tree is in the process of failing.\r\n\r\nEach type of defect has a distinctive range of symptoms that indicates its severity and potential to fail.  At the lowest end of the spectrum, the defect does not appear to be currently affecting the structural integrity of the tree.  A tree that has a moderate potential to fail is likely to fail in the near future.  At the highest level, defects are causing tree failure and are therefore of present concern.\r\n\r\nThe location of the defect can be a critical factor when determining the hazard level of an individual tree.  Tree stems have a zone called the ?hot spot? which is presumed to be mechanically weaker than wood above and below it.  The hot spot zone occurs about 4 feet above the groundline up to the lowest branch.  Hypothetically this is where the stem would snap off if enough force were applied to bend the tree over.  If an additional defect occurs in the hot spot assume the severity of the defect is worse than it appears because of its location on the stem.  \r\n\r\nTrees are living organisms under constant change and the introduction of recreational activities can induce or intensify detrimental changes in them.  No two trees will respond to these changes in the same way.  There is a natural variability in the trees? response, so defect severity will also be variable in each tree.  Remember that these are guidelines and no absolute rules can be made because of the natural variability of trees and their defects. Inspectors need to use their judgment and experience when evaluating and assessing tree defects.\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 15Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n					Tree picture\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 16Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1	Cracks\r\n\r\n	Cracks = a separation of wood, a fissure or deep split in the bark and wood.\r\nCracks can occur in stems and branches; they may even extend up from the roots into the lower stem.\r\n\r\nCracks are the number one hazardous defect because they indicate the tree is already failing.\r\n\r\nCracks can be generated in two ways, (1) from short-term injuries such as storm damage or the impact from heavy equipment, or (2) from improper wound closure over a period of years.  Most cracks develop from improper closure of wounds.  The wounds behind a crack may be sound or decayed.\r\n\r\nIf the wound does not close, the layers of bark and wood forming the margins of the wood meet but do not grow together and do not seal over the wound.  These layers curl inward on each side of the wound and form inrolled bark and wood.  As more layers of bark and wood are added, the crack becomes more pronounced.  The crack will continue to grow as new wood is added to the inrolled bark, increasing the separating force between the two sides. Rams-horning is another term for inrolled bark and wood.  Rams-horned cracks become more hazardous as they enlarge and generate secondary cracks in the stem.  \r\n\r\nIf there is another defect in the same stem segment that has a crack like a canker or a weak branch union failure may be imminent and corrective action should be taken as soon as possible.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPicture insert????\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 17Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	High Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	A crack goes completely through the stem or branch.

A weak branch union is structurally unsound because bark layers are ingrown; bark has formed inside the wood in the union.\r\n\r\nThe term for this is included bark.  Unlike wood, bark has no power to hold the branches together.  As more and more bark is included inside the tree the remaining woody connections between branches can?t support the weight of the branch and the weak union fails.  The branch breaks off or the tree splits open.\r\n\r\nWeak unions are characterized by a sharp angle between the stem (V-shaped connection), and the presence of included bark in the union and by the presence of inrolled bark on the branch bark ridge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 18Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	High Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	A weak branch union that is cracked, cankered or decayed.\r\n&#9679;	A weak union in the tree?s ?hot spot?. \r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	A weak union with inrolled bark at the branch bark ridge.\r\n\r\nStrong branch unions are characterized by a U-shaped connection, branch angles approaching 90 degrees and upturned branch bark ridges at branch junctions.  When the branch bark ridge is upturned, there is no included bark.  Wood from the branch grows together with wood from the stem creating a sound union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsert picture?..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 19Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3	Stem or Branch Decay\r\n\r\nDecayed wood = Wood that has rotted or is missing.  Decay always results in less structural strength  and stability.\r\n\r\nDecay is caused by fungi, which infect wounds in the bark and wood.  Over a period of years the fungi consumes and degrades the wood making it structurally unsound.  When a tree is wounded it compartmentalizes the infected or injured wood so new wood laid down after the wound is free from decay.  The diameter of the tree at the time of wounding is generally the only part invaded by decay fungi from the wound.  If this decay process goes on long enough a hollow the same size diameter as the tree at the time of the wounding can result.  This process may take many years.  Wounds occurring later may result in new decay columns outside the older ones, sometimes enlarging the diameter of the hollow.  \r\n\r\nThe most dangerous decay-causing fungi are the canker-rot fungi.  They can overcome the tree?s efforts at compartmentalization and spread outward into wood formed after the year it was wounded.  Infection by canker-rot fungi usually results in more extensive decay, the entire cylinder of wood can be structurally weakened.  Trees are easily fractured at the site of canker-rot infections.  Some common canker-rot fungi and their host are: Inonotus obliquus on birch, Phellinus pini on conifers, Phellinus everhartii on oak, and Inonotus glomeratus on maple. \r\n\r\nThe health and vigor of a tree?s crown does not indicate whether there is internal decay or not.  Trees require only a thin layer of bark and sapwood to transport water and nutrients to the crown.  The crown will be visibly healthy even if internal decay is present. \r\n\r\nFungal fruiting bodies on the tree or roots and growing on the ground adjacent to the tree are reliable indicators of decay.\r\n\r\nHigh Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker-rot infection (fruiting body) present in tree?s ?hot spot.?\r\n&#9679;	Cavity or decay present (fruiting body) associated with a weak branch union or an open crack.\r\n&#9679;	Any branch with decay.\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker-rot infection.\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 20Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4	Cankers\r\n\r\nA canker is an area of dead bark and cambium anywhere on the tree, often affecting the wood beneath.  Fungi, insects, weather or mechanical damage such as lantern burn wounds can cause cankers.  Stems and branches often fracture on or near cankers.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of cankers, annual and perennial.  Annual cankers are short-lived infections, which do not affect the tree?s structural integrity.  Perennial cankers are long-term tree/fungus associations, which can alter the tree form and structure and take on a target or diffused appearance.  Cankers increase the likelihood of stem breakage or kill the tree above the canker location.  Cankers are more hazardous if they affect more than half of the circumference of the tree.  \r\n\r\nHigh Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker is in the tree?s ?hot spot? and affects more than half of the tree circumference.\r\n&#9679;	Canker and decay in the tree?s ?hot spot.?\r\n&#9679;	Canker is physically connected to a crack or another defect.\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker affects more than half the stem?s circumference.\r\n&#9679;	Large old wound or canker at base of leaning tree.\r\n\r\n5.5	Dead Trees, Tops or Branches\r\n\r\nA dead tree, branch or treetop is structurally unsound.  Dead tops or branches may remain attached to live trees for several years or may fall off suddenly. Dead branches commonly break off near or at the main stem.  Dead treetops frequently break off just above the live stem.  Dead trees can fracture anywhere, at the ground level, in the tree?s ?hot spot? or anywhere there was a defect.  \r\n\r\nHigh Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Any dead tree.\r\n&#9679;	Any dead branch or dead top.\r\n&#9679;	Any lodged branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 21Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Any branch more than two-thirds dead, remove entire branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.6	Root Problems\r\n\r\nRoot problems serious enough to warrant corrective action are trees with partial windthrow, root severing, missing root systems, or extensive root rot.  Root problems are difficult to find and assess since tree roots are under ground.  Tree root systems extend two-four times the height of the tree and most of the water and nutrient absorbing roots are within 12 inches of the soil surface.  \r\n\r\nRoot problems are often a combination of mechanical disruption of the root system and reduced vigor.  The mechanical support of a root system can be disrupted by soil erosion, severing the roots or extensive root rot.  Construction activities, soil compaction, paving, lowering the soil grade, etc. reduce rooting area.  Soil compaction is caused by heavy equipment, auto traffic or prolonged foot traffic.  Flooding, raising the soil grade, and application of salts and herbicides can reduce root vigor.  \r\n\r\nRoot problems only become apparent when tree crowns begin to show symptoms or when signs of root failure become obvious.  Root lifting, partial windthrow, soil mounding, or recently leaning tree is an obvious sign that the root system is failing.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTree picture?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 22Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nIf construction has taken place under the crown, or excavation has occurred within ten feet of the stem, assess the impact this may have had on the mechanical support of the tree.

In most cases poor tree architecture is the tree?s response to past changes.  It may take many years for the tree?s response to fully develop to those changes. Examples listed in table 5.1\r\n\r\nTable 5.1\r\nCause	Watch for?\r\nTree clearing or branch pruning in nearby trees	Change in growth habit or branch losses\r\nBranch out of proportion with rest of tree, growing into a new hole in the canopy	Branch failure\r\nBranch with sharp twist or bend	Branch failure\r\nMultiple branches or co-dominant stems arising in one area of the stem	Branch failure\r\nTree was topped in the past	Branch or stem failure in upper crown\r\nTree growing at a sharp angle from the ground and one of the following: crack, root rot, stem decay, or after a severe storm	Tree failure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 23Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	High Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Tree leaning over target with an angle greater than 45 degrees to the lean.\r\n&#9679;	Tree leaning over target and it has another defect in the ?hot spot.?\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Branches with a twist, sharp angle or bend in them.\r\n&#9679;	Branches lopsided or unbalanced with respect to rest of the crown, especially if nearby trees were pruned or removed within the last ten years.\r\n\r\n5.8	Hazard Tree Assessment Guide\r\n\r\nThere are several factors that must be considered while inspecting individual trees.  These factors are the defect(s) present, tree species, tree age and size, tree condition and potential targets.  This guide is a synopsis of the seven defects and hazard levels.  Trees with high hazard potential warrant corrective action as soon as possible.  Moderate hazard defects are discretionary: the park superintendent or designee may elect to correct them before the next inspection.  \r\n\r\nDefect location can be a critical factor when determining the hazard potential of an individual tree.  The ?hot spot? zone is from about 4 feet above the ground line up to the lowest branch.  If an additional defect occurs in the hot spot, assume the defect is worse than it appears. \r\n\r\nThe number of defects a tree has is also critical when assessing for hazard potential.  Some trees have more than one defect and if two or more defects are connected, the tree can be very weak in that area.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 24Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	Hazard Potential Guide\r\n\r\nTable 5.2\r\nDefect	Moderate	High\r\nCrack	Hardwood stem has single crack with cavity or decay inside	Crack goes completely through stem.

An additional goal in corrective action is avoiding damage to existing trees and saplings in order to prevent defects from happening. If a hazardous situation exists there are three basic options for corrective action.\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Move the target.\r\n&#9679;	Remove the hazardous part of the tree by pruning, or\r\n&#9679;	Remove the tree.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to temporarily close the site until final corrective actions are taken on hazard trees.  Where people/park visitors may go back to site or simply use it by mistake, the use of warning signs and flagging is recommended to keep people away. \r\n\r\n6.1	Move the Target\r\n\r\nOne way of correcting a hazardous situation is to direct people away from the defective tree by moving the targeted picnic table, fire ring, tent spot, etc.   In other cases it may be necessary to permanently close an area to public access and relocate the campsite or building when the tree cannot be removed due to its historical value, stature or position in the canopy. \r\n\r\n6.2	Pruning\r\n\r\nA hazardous situation may be caused by a defective branch, while the rest of the tree is still sound.  In this case pruning the branch would solve the problem.  Hazardous situations requiring branch pruning are:\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Branch over 3? in diameter with a crack, decay, or dead.\r\n&#9679;	Weak branch union that doesn?t affect the entire tree.\r\n&#9679;	Large branch showing signs of decay.\r\n&#9679;	Large dead branch.\r\n&#9679;	Branch that forms a sharp angle or bend, or that twist.\r\n&#9679;	Branch that is lopsided or unbalanced with crown mass.\r\n&#9679;	Broken branches lodged in the crown should be removed.\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 26Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning can be good and bad.  If done improperly the immediate problem is corrected but cracks, decay, cankers or poor architecture are promoted and remain with the tree.  If done properly pruning does not create defects.  It is recommended that ?natural target pruning? be used. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration??.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 27Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nThe removal of the terminal portions of the crown, ?topping?, is a serious injury and has negative, long-term effects.  It is a temporary measure and the tree will again be hazardous due to decay in the topped stem, poor architecture and weak unions in the newly developed top.  It is not normally an accepted practice.  However, topping can be acceptable when dead or broken tops need to be removed.  Never cut into live wood when topping or you run the risk of promoting rapid decay in the entire stem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3	Tree Removal\r\n\r\nRemoval of a tree is considered a last resort since tree growth is a long-term process and removal may lead to increased windthrow on the remaining trees, and may reduce the aesthetic values of the recreation area.  Corrective actions should be avoided after March 1st in trees that are candidates for denning mammals or cavity nesting birds.  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of any protected birds or eggs or conducting an activity that threatens or disturbs nest, eggs, birds and their young.  This includes both cavity and cup nesting species.   Assessments can be done any time of the year, however timing of corrective action needs to consider probable use of the trees by birds and mammals. Contact the natural resource section of our division prior to the removal of any tree containing endangered or threatened species.   \r\n\r\nWhen tree removal is prescribed the goal should be to minimize the damage to adjacent trees.  Wounding of surrounding trees is the major cause of future defects.  Damage can be reduced by, limbing or topping a tree before felling.  When removing felled trees care must be taken not to wound the trunks or roots of surrounding trees.  The best season for tree pruning and felling is in the winter when the ground is frozen and when trees and their respective pest are dormant. \r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 28Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n6.4	Preventing Future Hazards\r\n\r\nWhen recreation facilities are being constructed, trees are often wounded by, trenching, blacktopping, changing the grade, and heavy machinery.  During site  maintenance, wounds are caused by, mowers, weed trimmers, falling trees and limbs, and improper pruning techniques.  Trees can also be damaged by careless use of herbicides.  Park visitors inflict many wounds with such activities as, pounding nails into trees, burning trees with lanterns, gathering and chopping firewood, and damaging trees with vehicles.  \r\n\r\nAny activity that scrapes, removes or kills the bark and cambium cause a wound.  Roots as well as stems and branches can be wounded.  The prevention of wounds can not be stressed enough, because wounds initiate the formation of cracks and other defects. \r\n\r\nWhile planning and developing a recreation site, use ideas such as; minimize human intervention (paving, trenching, changing the grade, etc.), use corridors for equipment travel, use fencing to limit vehicle movement and save islands of trees not individual trees.  Teach workers and employees not to wound trees when mowing, trimming, felling trees or pruning trees.  Park visitors can also be taught to respect trees and preserve the site?s natural beauty.  \r\n\r\nWounds serve as the entrances for fungi, which cause the decay process.  By preventing wounding and promoting rapid wound closure, decay problems will be kept to a minimum. Rapid wound closure occurs when the tree is in good condition and the wound is small.  Use natural target pruning as the method of choice when pruning is recommended.  \r\n\r\nRoots damaged by construction or maintenance activities can develop root and butt rot, which often leads to stem cracks and tree failure.  In addition, root damage may cause top dieback, increasing the amount of dead wood in the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 29Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n6.5	Program Follow-up\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of a hazard tree program needs to be evaluated.  Evaluations  provide the park employee who has been assigned the responsibility of inspecting for hazardous trees the feed back they need to increase their proficiency.  Inspectors should be on site when trees they have judged to be hazards are removed or pruned.  This will allow the inspectors to compare their assessment of external indicators and potential hazard to the real evidence of internal defects.  It is also recommended that inspectors be on site during storm damage clean up to gain experience in rating important defects and their respective actions to environmental conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 7.0Page: 30Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0	TRAINING\r\n\r\nEmployees shall be trained in and familiar with the safety related work practices, safety procedures, and other safety requirements in this section that pertain to the use of chain saws and felling trees.  \r\n\r\nEmployees shall be familiar with the Employee and Workplace Safety Guideline and trained in accordance with any special requirements of that guideline or sections as necessary for their safety. \r\n\r\n7.1	Training Requirements\r\n\r\nDivision employees (rangers and maintenance) felling hazardous trees will be trained at a minimum to the following requirements:\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Staff Directive 89-9 Power Tool/Equipment Checklist.\r\n&#9679;	NC State Parks S-212 Chain Saw Training.\r\n&#9679;	Review Safe Operating Practices (SOP) on all associated equipment, chain saws, brush chipper, etc.\r\n&#9679;	First Responder Training.\r\n&#9679;	CPR/AED.\r\n\r\nTraining may be classroom and on-the-job practical exercises.

Intensive recreation activities, such as camping, can cause tree damage by altering the tree?s natural environment, or by directly damaging roots, stems and branches.  These changes can lead to the development of hazardous trees, which pose a safety risk for park visitors to recreation sites.\r\n\r\nThe park staff is in the unenviable position of trying to preserve a recreation site?s natural setting while trying to provide reasonable public safety by identifying and then correcting hazardous trees.  Some tree failures can be predicted on the basis of identifiable defects; some failures cannot be predicted.  There will be failures during severe storms that have nothing to do with tree defects.  There are significant unknown or undetectable interactions occurring within forest and shade tree communities that may result in hazard trees. \r\n\r\nAll hazardous trees cannot be detected, corrected or eliminated.  However, the park staff implementing a hazard tree management program can help make a recreation site reasonably safe while preserving its natural setting.  This guideline will provide the framework for a hazard tree management program, which consists of regular and systematic inspections based on readily identifiable tree defects. \r\n\r\nWhat is a hazard tree?  A hazard tree is defined as any defective tree, or tree part, that poses a high risk upon failure to cause injury to people or damage to property.  A hazard tree has one or more defects, which decreases its structural integrity and gives it an increased potential for failure.  Defects that are visible or detectable include cracks, decayed wood, weak branch unions, cankers, poor tree architecture, root problems and dead trees or branches.  \r\n\r\nA defective tree is not considered hazardous unless there is a nearby target that it could hit.  A target could be a person, vehicle, tent, building, picnic table, campfire ring, recreation equipment and etc.  The term target area is used to describe an area where people or their equipment, are likely to stop and congregate.  An individual campsite is an example of a target area.\r\nBy definition, a hazard tree = a defective tree plus a target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 2.0Page: 4Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 	GUIDELINE RESPONSIBILITIES\r\n\r\n	Division Director\r\nThe division director is responsible to ensure the overall development and administration of the Hazardous Tree Guideline.\r\n\r\n	Superintendent of State Parks\r\nThe superintendent of state parks is responsible for the management and supervision of the Hazardous Tree Guideline and to ensure compliance throughout the division.\r\n\r\n	Division Safety Officer\r\nThe division safety officer is responsible for the administration of the Hazardous Tree Guideline.

Inspections, maintenance and corrective action will accomplish this goal.\r\n\r\nOn an annual basis trees in the following areas will be inspected:  drive-in campsites, hike-in campsites, group camps, picnic areas, around buildings and facilities in developed campgrounds, hiking trails/bridal trails, public water accesses, administrative sites, roadways and parking lot peripheries. \r\n\r\nNot covered by this policy are trees along trout streams, abandoned forest roads, and natural forest areas not generally used by park visitors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 6Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0	 	INSPECTIONS\r\n\r\nAn inspection is a systematic method of examining and rating trees.  The purpose of a hazard tree inspection is to detect defective trees in target areas, assesses the severity of the defects and recommend\r\n corrective action before tree failure occurs.  \r\n\r\nThe first step of an inspection is to decide which areas should be inspected.  In general inspection priorities are based upon human mobility within the target area, the duration of site occupancy and the level of site maintenance.  \r\n\r\nThe second step is to choose appropriate personnel to perform the inspections.  Park personnel (inspector = Ranger/Maintenance) assigned to this task should be familiar with tree species found on site, tree defects and their potential for failure.  \r\n\r\nAt the discretion of the park superintendent, one of the following inspection methods should be used:\r\n\r\n4.1	Individual Tree Inspection\r\nEach tree in the specified area or any tree that could reach the target area will receive a 360-degree visual inspection for flaws and viewed from bottom to top.  The designated inspector can make the final decision for corrective action.  On occasion the inspector will have to confer with the park superintendent for guidance on how to handle a sensitive or technically difficult situation.  This type of inspection will be standard for high-risk areas. (See table 4.1 for high and low risk areas)\r\n\r\n4.2	Walk Through Inspection\r\nWalk through the area visually scanning for potential flaws.  This includes inspections of individual trees suspected of being hazardous, as above.  Walk through inspections are standard for low risk areas. \r\n\r\nUse of binoculars, wood chisels, hammers, coring devices, and other tools enhance the quality of the inspection process.  Areas are best inspected prior to peak visitation times.  Inspections should be conducted to allow sufficient time to schedule necessary work.  Areas should remain closed until hazardous tree conditions are eliminated.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 7Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nInspections can be done any time of the year.  The best time to see structural defects is during the leaf-off season.  Early spring and late autumn when visitor are few would work well.  Inspections done during leaf-on seasons, give a better sense of tree condition and location of dead branches.  \r\n\r\nIf construction or severe storm occurred since the last inspection, then additional inspection should be done.  As soon as possible after a severe storm a thorough inspection of high-risk areas and intensively used areas should be done to find trees and branches that failed, fractured or developed a lean during the storm. Strong winds can take a minor defect and change into a major one that may require corrective action.  \r\n\r\nWhen the inspector (s) arrive at the site they must determine which trees to inspect.  Not all trees need to be inspected.  Only trees that could fall onto a target or into the target area need to be inspected.  The target area will vary according to facility type, see table 4.2.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to inspect each individual tree for defects.  During the inspection the severity of each tree?s defects are judged with respect to defect levels established in section 5.0 (Assessment).  The final step of the inspection is to provide documentation.  Use the inspection form located in the appendix along with a PR-63.  A separate inspection form should be used for each facility type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n					            See table 4.2 for target area.\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 8Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4.1 High and Low Risk Areas\r\n	\r\nFacility Type	High Risk	Low Risk\r\nDrive-in campsite	X	\r\nHike-in campsite	X	\r\nGroup camps	X	\r\nPicnic areas	X	\r\nRestroom facilities	X	\r\nHiking trails		X\r\nHorse bridle trails		X\r\nPublic water accesses		X\r\nRoadways		X\r\nParking lot peripheries		X\r\nAdministrative office sites		X\r\n\r\nTable 4.2 Target Areas\r\n\r\nFacility Type	Target Area\r\nDrive-in campsite	Target area will vary from park to park based on campground layout.

Special trips or visits for the sole purpose of hazard tree inspections do not have to be made for administrative sites, parking lot peripheries, roadways and public water accesses.

An awareness of the environment and human-related factors influencing the site can aid in detecting and assessing tree defects.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Factors\r\n\r\nThe following table outlines a few common environmental problems, the respective initial damage or changes they cause, and the type of defects that commonly result.  \r\n\r\nTable 4.4\r\nCause	Initial Damage or Change	Defects Observed\r\nFire	Wounds to stem	Stem decay, cavities, fire scars\r\nPest Infestation	Crown dieback, stem wounds, reduced vigor	Topkill, cankers, decay, tree mortality, root rot\r\nDrought	Wilting, crown dieback	Topkill, tree mortality\r\nFlooding	Root and rootlet mortality, crown dieback	Topkill, tree mortality\r\nShallow soils or hardpan layer soils	Shallow root system	Windthrow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 11Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman-related factors\r\n\r\nIf you find trees that are experiencing problems you will usually find some human-made alterations that are to blame.  The following table outlines some of the commonly observed defects resulting from a variety of human causes.\r\nTable 4.5\r\nCause	Initial damage or change	Defects observed\r\nPast logging	Stem wounds, stump sprouts, change in species composition	Stem decay, cracks, cankers\r\nPast grazing	Soil compaction causes rootlet mortality, injury to exposed roots	Root rot, windthrow, decay, cracks\r\nCompaction due to foot or vehicle traffic	Soil compaction causes rootlet mortality, limited root development	Root rot, crown dieback, tree mortality\r\nConstruction	Stem and root wounds	Decay, cracks, cankers, root rot, crown dieback, tree mortality\r\nTrenching	Roots wounded and severed	Windthrow, root rot, crown dieback\r\nRaising the soil grade	Rootlet mortality	Root death, root rot, crown dieback\r\nLowering the soil grade	Roots wounded and severed	Windthrow, root rot, crown dieback\r\nSurfacing and paving	Rootlet mortality, lack of water and oxygen	Rootlet dieback, crown dieback, tree mortality\r\nRemoving nearby trees	Root and branch growth	Poor tree architecture, windthrow\r\nTransplanting trees	Root loss during process	Slow growth, dieback\r\nInappropriate species planted	Poor vigor and decline	Topkill, branch breakage, tree mortality\r\nMowing, weedwhip injuries	Stem and root wounds	Decay, cracks, root rot, cankers, kills small trees\r\nHerbicides	Defoliation, wilting or browning of foliage	Crown dieback, tree mortality\r\nPoor pruning practices	Wounds caused by flush cuts, tipping, topping, long branch stubs	Decay, cankers, cracks, poor architecture\r\nNails, lanterns, hatchet marks, bark peeling	Wounds to stem	Cankers, decay, cracks, tree mortality\r\n\r\nBy being aware of site history and management practices, inspectors can anticipate some of the defects, which might occur and can be better prepared to evaluate the severity of those defects. \r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 12Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n4.5	Individual Tree Evaluations\r\n\r\nThe most important part of an inspection is evaluating individual trees for their potential as hazards trees.  The field examinations must be conducted in a careful and systematic manner.  The search for defects in individual trees is a time consuming and repetitive process, so allow plenty of time for inspections.  Individual tree evaluations must include a close inspection of the rooting zone, root flares, main stem, branches and branch unions.  Use a pair of binoculars to visually inspect the higher branches.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors should be considered while evaluating individual trees.  These factors include but are not limited to; potential targets, target area, the presence of cracks and other defects, tree species, tree age and size, and tree condition.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 4.0Page: 13Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	Potential Target and Target Area\r\nDefective trees are not hazard trees unless there is a target.  If the defective tree in question would fail at the groundline, fall and not reach the target/target area, it is not considered a hazard tree since it poses no serious threat.  Targets may be campsites, parking lots, picnic areas, buildings, public water accesses, or anywhere people are likely to congregate and/or stop. \r\n\r\nCracks\r\nCracks are a principle factor in hazard tree evaluation.  A crack is a fissure or deep split in the wood.  Cracks are the visible sign that tree failure has begun and that corrective action is necessary.\r\n\r\nDefects(s) Present\r\nDefects are visible signals that a tree is failing or has the potential to fail.  There are seven main categories of defects: cracks, weak branch unions, stem or branch decay, cankers, dead trees and branches, root problems and poor tree architecture.  \r\nDefects affect the structural integrity of the tree.  Each type of defect has a range of severity; from no action required to requiring more immediate action.  Often trees will have more than one defect.   \r\n\r\nTree Species\r\nThe type of defect a tree has is often influenced by the species of the tree.  Some species are more prone to failure from certain kinds of defects.  Silver Maples tend to form codominant stems and thus form weak branch unions.  Learn the common defects known to trouble the tree species in your area and actively search for those defects.  \r\n\r\nTree Age and Size\r\nThe majority of serious defects are found in old and/or large trees.  This is because old trees have had time to accumulate injuries and infections and more time for the problems to develop into structural defects.  Large trees have greater structural stresses due to their size and weight.  Defects identified and corrected in younger trees may reduce future hazards as they grow in age and size.\r\n\r\nTree Condition\r\nDetermining tree condition involves evaluating the overall health and vigor of the tree.  Trees in good condition will have live full crowns, few dead branches and full-sized foliage on actively growing branches.  Trees in poor condition or declining trees will have branches dying back as well as many dead branches, with smaller and off-colored foliage.  Declining trees have a higher probability of branch failures and premature death. \r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 14Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0	ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nA sound tree becomes potentially hazardous when the trees woody structure is weakened by defects.  Most defects can be linked to past wounding, pest infestations or severe storms that fracture, destroyed or decayed the wood.  Defects are visible signs that a tree has failed, is failing or has the potential to fail.  These are the seven main categories of defects:\r\n\r\nCracks\r\nWeak branch unions\r\nStem or branch decay\r\nCankers\r\nDead trees, tops or branches\r\nRoot problems\r\nPoor tree architecture\r\n\r\nCracks are the most serious defect because they indicate that the tree is in the process of failing.\r\n\r\nEach type of defect has a distinctive range of symptoms that indicates its severity and potential to fail.  At the lowest end of the spectrum, the defect does not appear to be currently affecting the structural integrity of the tree.  A tree that has a moderate potential to fail is likely to fail in the near future.  At the highest level, defects are causing tree failure and are therefore of present concern.\r\n\r\nThe location of the defect can be a critical factor when determining the hazard level of an individual tree.  Tree stems have a zone called the ?hot spot? which is presumed to be mechanically weaker than wood above and below it.  The hot spot zone occurs about 4 feet above the groundline up to the lowest branch.  Hypothetically this is where the stem would snap off if enough force were applied to bend the tree over.  If an additional defect occurs in the hot spot assume the severity of the defect is worse than it appears because of its location on the stem.  \r\n\r\nTrees are living organisms under constant change and the introduction of recreational activities can induce or intensify detrimental changes in them.  No two trees will respond to these changes in the same way.  There is a natural variability in the trees? response, so defect severity will also be variable in each tree.  Remember that these are guidelines and no absolute rules can be made because of the natural variability of trees and their defects. Inspectors need to use their judgment and experience when evaluating and assessing tree defects.\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 15Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n					Tree picture\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 16Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1	Cracks\r\n\r\n	Cracks = a separation of wood, a fissure or deep split in the bark and wood.\r\nCracks can occur in stems and branches; they may even extend up from the roots into the lower stem.\r\n\r\nCracks are the number one hazardous defect because they indicate the tree is already failing.\r\n\r\nCracks can be generated in two ways, (1) from short-term injuries such as storm damage or the impact from heavy equipment, or (2) from improper wound closure over a period of years.  Most cracks develop from improper closure of wounds.  The wounds behind a crack may be sound or decayed.\r\n\r\nIf the wound does not close, the layers of bark and wood forming the margins of the wood meet but do not grow together and do not seal over the wound.  These layers curl inward on each side of the wound and form inrolled bark and wood.  As more layers of bark and wood are added, the crack becomes more pronounced.  The crack will continue to grow as new wood is added to the inrolled bark, increasing the separating force between the two sides. Rams-horning is another term for inrolled bark and wood.  Rams-horned cracks become more hazardous as they enlarge and generate secondary cracks in the stem.  \r\n\r\nIf there is another defect in the same stem segment that has a crack like a canker or a weak branch union failure may be imminent and corrective action should be taken as soon as possible.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPicture insert????\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 17Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	High Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	A crack goes completely through the stem or branch.

A weak branch union is structurally unsound because bark layers are ingrown; bark has formed inside the wood in the union.\r\n\r\nThe term for this is included bark.  Unlike wood, bark has no power to hold the branches together.  As more and more bark is included inside the tree the remaining woody connections between branches can?t support the weight of the branch and the weak union fails.  The branch breaks off or the tree splits open.\r\n\r\nWeak unions are characterized by a sharp angle between the stem (V-shaped connection), and the presence of included bark in the union and by the presence of inrolled bark on the branch bark ridge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 18Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	High Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	A weak branch union that is cracked, cankered or decayed.\r\n&#9679;	A weak union in the tree?s ?hot spot?. \r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	A weak union with inrolled bark at the branch bark ridge.\r\n\r\nStrong branch unions are characterized by a U-shaped connection, branch angles approaching 90 degrees and upturned branch bark ridges at branch junctions.  When the branch bark ridge is upturned, there is no included bark.  Wood from the branch grows together with wood from the stem creating a sound union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsert picture?..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 19Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3	Stem or Branch Decay\r\n\r\nDecayed wood = Wood that has rotted or is missing.  Decay always results in less structural strength  and stability.\r\n\r\nDecay is caused by fungi, which infect wounds in the bark and wood.  Over a period of years the fungi consumes and degrades the wood making it structurally unsound.  When a tree is wounded it compartmentalizes the infected or injured wood so new wood laid down after the wound is free from decay.  The diameter of the tree at the time of wounding is generally the only part invaded by decay fungi from the wound.  If this decay process goes on long enough a hollow the same size diameter as the tree at the time of the wounding can result.  This process may take many years.  Wounds occurring later may result in new decay columns outside the older ones, sometimes enlarging the diameter of the hollow.  \r\n\r\nThe most dangerous decay-causing fungi are the canker-rot fungi.  They can overcome the tree?s efforts at compartmentalization and spread outward into wood formed after the year it was wounded.  Infection by canker-rot fungi usually results in more extensive decay, the entire cylinder of wood can be structurally weakened.  Trees are easily fractured at the site of canker-rot infections.  Some common canker-rot fungi and their host are: Inonotus obliquus on birch, Phellinus pini on conifers, Phellinus everhartii on oak, and Inonotus glomeratus on maple. \r\n\r\nThe health and vigor of a tree?s crown does not indicate whether there is internal decay or not.  Trees require only a thin layer of bark and sapwood to transport water and nutrients to the crown.  The crown will be visibly healthy even if internal decay is present. \r\n\r\nFungal fruiting bodies on the tree or roots and growing on the ground adjacent to the tree are reliable indicators of decay.\r\n\r\nHigh Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker-rot infection (fruiting body) present in tree?s ?hot spot.?\r\n&#9679;	Cavity or decay present (fruiting body) associated with a weak branch union or an open crack.\r\n&#9679;	Any branch with decay.\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker-rot infection.\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 20Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4	Cankers\r\n\r\nA canker is an area of dead bark and cambium anywhere on the tree, often affecting the wood beneath.  Fungi, insects, weather or mechanical damage such as lantern burn wounds can cause cankers.  Stems and branches often fracture on or near cankers.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of cankers, annual and perennial.  Annual cankers are short-lived infections, which do not affect the tree?s structural integrity.  Perennial cankers are long-term tree/fungus associations, which can alter the tree form and structure and take on a target or diffused appearance.  Cankers increase the likelihood of stem breakage or kill the tree above the canker location.  Cankers are more hazardous if they affect more than half of the circumference of the tree.  \r\n\r\nHigh Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker is in the tree?s ?hot spot? and affects more than half of the tree circumference.\r\n&#9679;	Canker and decay in the tree?s ?hot spot.?\r\n&#9679;	Canker is physically connected to a crack or another defect.\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Canker affects more than half the stem?s circumference.\r\n&#9679;	Large old wound or canker at base of leaning tree.\r\n\r\n5.5	Dead Trees, Tops or Branches\r\n\r\nA dead tree, branch or treetop is structurally unsound.  Dead tops or branches may remain attached to live trees for several years or may fall off suddenly. Dead branches commonly break off near or at the main stem.  Dead treetops frequently break off just above the live stem.  Dead trees can fracture anywhere, at the ground level, in the tree?s ?hot spot? or anywhere there was a defect.  \r\n\r\nHigh Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Any dead tree.\r\n&#9679;	Any dead branch or dead top.\r\n&#9679;	Any lodged branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 21Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nModerate Failure Potential\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Any branch more than two-thirds dead, remove entire branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.6	Root Problems\r\n\r\nRoot problems serious enough to warrant corrective action are trees with partial windthrow, root severing, missing root systems, or extensive root rot.  Root problems are difficult to find and assess since tree roots are under ground.  Tree root systems extend two-four times the height of the tree and most of the water and nutrient absorbing roots are within 12 inches of the soil surface.  \r\n\r\nRoot problems are often a combination of mechanical disruption of the root system and reduced vigor.  The mechanical support of a root system can be disrupted by soil erosion, severing the roots or extensive root rot.  Construction activities, soil compaction, paving, lowering the soil grade, etc. reduce rooting area.  Soil compaction is caused by heavy equipment, auto traffic or prolonged foot traffic.  Flooding, raising the soil grade, and application of salts and herbicides can reduce root vigor.  \r\n\r\nRoot problems only become apparent when tree crowns begin to show symptoms or when signs of root failure become obvious.  Root lifting, partial windthrow, soil mounding, or recently leaning tree is an obvious sign that the root system is failing.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTree picture?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 22Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nIf construction has taken place under the crown, or excavation has occurred within ten feet of the stem, assess the impact this may have had on the mechanical support of the tree.

In most cases poor tree architecture is the tree?s response to past changes.  It may take many years for the tree?s response to fully develop to those changes.

These factors are the defect(s) present, tree species, tree age and size, tree condition and potential targets.  This guide is a synopsis of the seven defects and hazard levels.  Trees with high hazard potential warrant corrective action as soon as possible.  Moderate hazard defects are discretionary: the park superintendent or designee may elect to correct them before the next inspection.  \r\n\r\nDefect location can be a critical factor when determining the hazard potential of an individual tree.  The ?hot spot? zone is from about 4 feet above the ground line up to the lowest branch.  If an additional defect occurs in the hot spot, assume the defect is worse than it appears. \r\n\r\nThe number of defects a tree has is also critical when assessing for hazard potential.  Some trees have more than one defect and if two or more defects are connected, the tree can be very weak in that area.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 5.0Page: 24Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n	Hazard Potential Guide\r\n\r\nTable 5.2\r\nDefect	Moderate	High\r\nCrack	Hardwood stem has single crack with cavity or decay inside	Crack goes completely through stem.

An additional goal in corrective action is avoiding damage to existing trees and saplings in order to prevent defects from happening. If a hazardous situation exists there are three basic options for corrective action.\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Move the target.\r\n&#9679;	Remove the hazardous part of the tree by pruning, or\r\n&#9679;	Remove the tree.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to temporarily close the site until final corrective actions are taken on hazard trees.  Where people/park visitors may go back to site or simply use it by mistake, the use of warning signs and flagging is recommended to keep people away. \r\n\r\n6.1	Move the Target\r\n\r\nOne way of correcting a hazardous situation is to direct people away from the defective tree by moving the targeted picnic table, fire ring, tent spot, etc.   In other cases it may be necessary to permanently close an area to public access and relocate the campsite or building when the tree cannot be removed due to its historical value, stature or position in the canopy. \r\n\r\n6.2	Pruning\r\n\r\nA hazardous situation may be caused by a defective branch, while the rest of the tree is still sound.  In this case pruning the branch would solve the problem.  Hazardous situations requiring branch pruning are:\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Branch over 3? in diameter with a crack, decay, or dead.\r\n&#9679;	Weak branch union that doesn?t affect the entire tree.\r\n&#9679;	Large branch showing signs of decay.\r\n&#9679;	Large dead branch.\r\n&#9679;	Branch that forms a sharp angle or bend, or that twist.\r\n&#9679;	Branch that is lopsided or unbalanced with crown mass.\r\n&#9679;	Broken branches lodged in the crown should be removed.\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 26Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning can be good and bad.  If done improperly the immediate problem is corrected but cracks, decay, cankers or poor architecture are promoted and remain with the tree.  If done properly pruning does not create defects.  It is recommended that ?natural target pruning? be used. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration??.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 27Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\nThe removal of the terminal portions of the crown, ?topping?, is a serious injury and has negative, long-term effects.  It is a temporary measure and the tree will again be hazardous due to decay in the topped stem, poor architecture and weak unions in the newly developed top.  It is not normally an accepted practice.  However, topping can be acceptable when dead or broken tops need to be removed.  Never cut into live wood when topping or you run the risk of promoting rapid decay in the entire stem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3	Tree Removal\r\n\r\nRemoval of a tree is considered a last resort since tree growth is a long-term process and removal may lead to increased windthrow on the remaining trees, and may reduce the aesthetic values of the recreation area.  Corrective actions should be avoided after March 1st in trees that are candidates for denning mammals or cavity nesting birds.  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of any protected birds or eggs or conducting an activity that threatens or disturbs nest, eggs, birds and their young.  This includes both cavity and cup nesting species.   Assessments can be done any time of the year, however timing of corrective action needs to consider probable use of the trees by birds and mammals. Contact the natural resource section of our division prior to the removal of any tree containing endangered or threatened species.   \r\n\r\nWhen tree removal is prescribed the goal should be to minimize the damage to adjacent trees.  Wounding of surrounding trees is the major cause of future defects.  Damage can be reduced by, limbing or topping a tree before felling.  When removing felled trees care must be taken not to wound the trunks or roots of surrounding trees.  The best season for tree pruning and felling is in the winter when the ground is frozen and when trees and their respective pest are dormant. \r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 28Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n6.4	Preventing Future Hazards\r\n\r\nWhen recreation facilities are being constructed, trees are often wounded by, trenching, blacktopping, changing the grade, and heavy machinery.  During site  maintenance, wounds are caused by, mowers, weed trimmers, falling trees and limbs, and improper pruning techniques.  Trees can also be damaged by careless use of herbicides.  Park visitors inflict many wounds with such activities as, pounding nails into trees, burning trees with lanterns, gathering and chopping firewood, and damaging trees with vehicles.  \r\n\r\nAny activity that scrapes, removes or kills the bark and cambium cause a wound.  Roots as well as stems and branches can be wounded.  The prevention of wounds can not be stressed enough, because wounds initiate the formation of cracks and other defects. \r\n\r\nWhile planning and developing a recreation site, use ideas such as; minimize human intervention (paving, trenching, changing the grade, etc.), use corridors for equipment travel, use fencing to limit vehicle movement and save islands of trees not individual trees.  Teach workers and employees not to wound trees when mowing, trimming, felling trees or pruning trees.  Park visitors can also be taught to respect trees and preserve the site?s natural beauty.  \r\n\r\nWounds serve as the entrances for fungi, which cause the decay process.  By preventing wounding and promoting rapid wound closure, decay problems will be kept to a minimum. Rapid wound closure occurs when the tree is in good condition and the wound is small.  Use natural target pruning as the method of choice when pruning is recommended.  \r\n\r\nRoots damaged by construction or maintenance activities can develop root and butt rot, which often leads to stem cracks and tree failure.  In addition, root damage may cause top dieback, increasing the amount of dead wood in the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 6.0Page: 29Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n6.5	Program Follow-up\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of a hazard tree program needs to be evaluated.  Evaluations  provide the park employee who has been assigned the responsibility of inspecting for hazardous trees the feed back they need to increase their proficiency.  Inspectors should be on site when trees they have judged to be hazards are removed or pruned.  This will allow the inspectors to compare their assessment of external indicators and potential hazard to the real evidence of internal defects.  It is also recommended that inspectors be on site during storm damage clean up to gain experience in rating important defects and their respective actions to environmental conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuidelineOriginator: R Bowling	Hazardous Tree Management Guideline	Section: 7.0Page: 30Date: March 4, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0	TRAINING\r\n\r\nEmployees shall be trained in and familiar with the safety related work practices, safety procedures, and other safety requirements in this section that pertain to the use of chain saws and felling trees.  \r\n\r\nEmployees shall be familiar with the Employee and Workplace Safety Guideline and trained in accordance with any special requirements of that guideline or sections as necessary for their safety. \r\n\r\n7.1	Training Requirements\r\n\r\nDivision employees (rangers and maintenance) felling hazardous trees will be trained at a minimum to the following requirements:\r\n\r\n&#9679;	Staff Directive 89-9 Power Tool/Equipment Checklist.\r\n&#9679;	NC State Parks S-212 Chain Saw Training.\r\n&#9679;	Review Safe Operating Practices (SOP) on all associated equipment, chain saws, brush chipper, etc.\r\n&#9679;	First Responder Training.\r\n&#9679;	CPR/AED.\r\n\r\nTraining may be classroom and on-the-job practical exercises.

Guideline text amended by Staff Directive 90-4 remains in effect.\r\nAttachment\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF PARKS AND RECREATION\r\nJanuary 20, 1999\r\nSTAFF DIRECTIVE 99-2\r\nFROM:\r\nSuperintendent of State Parks \r\nParks Chief Ranger\r\nDistrict Superintendents\r\nPark Superintendents \r\nI&E Staff	\r\nPhil McKnelly \r\nTO:\r\nSUBJECT:\r\nRevision to the Interpretive Program Guideline\r\nThis revision provides for two levels of Canoe Program Leader, flatwater and whitewater. In addition, this revision lists prerequisites for all canoe and boat training. These prerequisites ensure that the permanent Division employee, who is planning to take a canoe or boat training, is a swimmer and has been trained in first aid and CPR. Other revisions were made to bring Appendix L into compliance with the Division\'s ADA Guideline. We need to ensure the safety of all participants, while at the same time, not discriminating against people with disabilities.\r\nIf you have any questions about these revisions, please contact the Lead I&E Specialist.\r\nPKM/MTK\r\n\r\n', '', 'APPENDIX L\r\n\r\nSAFETY PROCEDURES FOR AQUATIC PROGRAMMING\r\n\r\nIn order to insure the safety of participants in our aquatic interpretive programming services, the Division of Parks and Recreation has established guidelines for staffing, planning and conducting these services.\r\n\r\nI.) Boating and Canoeing\r\n\r\nA. Staff Training Requirements\r\n\r\nEach canoe or boating trip must be accompanied by at least one park staff member who has 	successfully fulfilled the following Prerequisite skills, holds the appropriate Program 	Leader certification (for Flatwater/Moving Water, Class II White Water, or Boating), and 	maintains a minimum leader/participant ratio of one leader per ten participant boats.\r\n\r\n1.) Prerequisite Skills Criteria\r\n\r\na) Have a minimum level of swimming skills at the Intermediate or Level IV 			of the American Red Cross, AND\r\n\r\nb) Be able to successfully complete the following swim test: tread water fully clothed in deep water for a minimum of two minutes, then take off his/her shoes and swim 50 feet, put on a life jacket and swim back to shore (a minimum of 50 feet) on his/her back, AND\r\n\r\nc) Be currently certified in CPR and have knowledge of basic first aid.  In the case where a ranger has not yet taken BLET, which includes first aid and CPR training, the Superintendent of State Parks may give permission for the ranger to attend a Canoe Program Leader training course as long as other prerequisites are fulfilled.  This ranger\'s Canoe Program Leader certification will remain incomplete until he/she successfully completes basic first aid and CPR training.\r\n\r\n2.) Canoe Program Leader Flatwater/Moving Water Training Criteria\r\n\r\na) Successfully complete the American Red Cross AFundamentals of 			Canoeing@ (15 hours), OR . . .\r\n\r\nAn American Canoe Association Course such as AMoving Water Course@ 			(24 hours), or AIntroduction to Flatwater  Paddling/ Introduction to River 			Paddling@ (16 hours total), AND\r\n \r\n\r\nb) Successfully complete additional training in trip organization, maintenance of equipment, and water rescue techniques.  This training should be provided by the American Red Cross, American Canoe Association, Nantahala Outdoor Center, or other organization as approved by the Superintendent of State Parks.	\r\n\r\n\r\n3.) Canoe Program Leader Class II/ Whitewater Training Criteria\r\n      Note: Division sponsored trips will not run Class III or above 		     rapids.	\r\n    		   \r\na) Successfully fulfill the above listed training for Canoe Program Leader 			Flatwater/Moving Water, AND\r\n\r\nb) American Red Cross Basic River Canoeing (canoeing in Class I and II 			whitewater), 20 hours, OR . . .\r\n\r\nAmerican Canoe Association Whitewater course (canoeing in CLASS I and 			II whitewater), 24 hours, OR . . .\r\n\r\nEquivalent training by another approved agency, one which fulfills the requirements of the Division and which substantially duplicates the training provided by the American Red Cross or American Canoe Association.  Approval is given by the Superintendent of State Parks.\r\n\r\n4.) Boating (non-powered) Program Leader Training Criteria\r\n\r\nEach Boating Program Leader must receive appropriate certification such as American Red Cross Basic Rowing, 12 hours, plus additional training hours in program leader skills such as trip planning, maintenance of equipment, and water rescue techniques.\r\n\r\nB. Certification\r\n\r\n1.) Certification will be provided by the North Carolina Division of Parks and 		Recreation upon successful completion of the appropriate Program Leader training.  \r\n\r\n2.) Certification must be renewed annually (on the calendar year) according to the 		following criteria:\r\n\r\na) Participate in a minimum of ten hours of boating/canoeing activities within the Program Leader\'s certification area.  Participation may be during duty hours or personal time and may involve division sponsored programs and activities, activities by other organizations, or personal.\r\n\r\nb) The park superintendent must verify continuing experience and 			recommend certification continuance on form PR-63.	  Refer to the 			Operations Management Calendar for information on when these reports are 			due.\r\n\r\nC. Safety Equipment\r\n\r\n1.) U.S. Coast Guard approved life jackets will be worn by participants and park staff at all times.\r\n\r\n \r\n2.) Participants should be advised that appropriate footgear and clothing will be worn while on or in the water at all times.\r\n\r\n3.) Equipment will be maintained properly while in use or stowed.\r\n\r\n4.) All boats will be fitted with sufficient buoyancy to support the full-permitted crew and equipment when waterlogged.   For flatwater canoeing, the normal flotation built into the boat is usually sufficient.\r\n\r\n5.) The trip leader is responsible for all required group equipment.  The trip leader should review the list below and use the items that are appropriate for his/her trip or body of water.  Suggested equipment:\r\n$ first aid kit\r\n$ repair materials\r\n$ throw rope or throw bag\r\n$ 10-foot piece of webbing (to be made into a loop using a Awater knot@ and 	   used as a Asling step@ to allow one to re-enter the canoe in open water)\r\n$ two carabiners for use in river rescue; i.e., boat retrieval (white water 	   programs)\r\n$  extra paddles\r\n$  extra life jackets\r\n\r\nD. Safety Procedures\r\n\r\n1.) Each trip must have a park staff member who has completed the appropriate training and holds a current NC DPR Canoe or Boating Program Leader certificate.  This person is the designated trip leader and is in charge of all water activities.\r\n\r\n2.) A participant boat to trip leader ratio of no greater than 10:1 should be observed.  If the group is larger (more than 10 boats), divide into smaller groups and assign a certified trip leader for each group.  \r\n\r\n3.) Prior to each trip, staff should check all life jackets and other equipment, and reject those items which are unsatisfactory. \r\n\r\n4.) The trip leader will have a thorough knowledge of the water body that is used for the program and be aware of how possible changes in season, weather and condition of the water can affect the difficulty of the trip.  The trip leader should gain this knowledge firsthand, from one or more float trips along the route of the intended activity.  Whenever possible, these Ascouting@ trips should be conducted in the company of someone experienced on the body of water.\r\n\r\n5.) The Park Superintendent must approve each boating activity.  The trip leader will establish and file a safety plan with the Park Superintendent before starting the trip.  This plan will include estimated arrival and departure times from certain areas.  Checkpoints will be established along the way at which radio contact could be made if necessary.  Note that trips in whitewater above Class II are not permitted.\r\n\r\n \r\n6.) With assistance from the District Interpretation and Education Specialist, the trip leader should determine the rules of conduct and required skills necessary for participation in each boating trip.   These rules and required skills should be clearly explained to the public when registering for the program and should also be read to the participants before beginning the trip (ADA requirements).\r\n\r\n7.) Before the actual trip begins, the trip leader should provide an opportunity for basic instruction on boating and should assess the skill level of the participants in maneuvering their boats.  Adjustments of instructions should be made to insure the safety of both individuals and the group.\r\n\r\n8.) A trip leader may prohibit any participant from joining a trip if the trip leader feels the participant=s safety or the safety of others might be jeopardized by the participant=s inclusion in the trip.   This decision should be based on the leader=s observation of the participant in relation to the rules of conduct and required skills previously established for each boating program.\r\n\r\n9.) The trip leader will inform participants of expected water conditions, explain safety procedures, and outline any emergency procedures.\r\n\r\n10.) Should an accident or injury occur during a boating program, the park staff designated as the trip leader is responsible for ensuring that the necessary first aid and evacuation procedures are completed.\r\n\r\nII.) Other Types of Water-based Activities\r\n\r\nA. Staff Training Requirements\r\n\r\n1.) Each aquatic program must be accompanied by at least one park staff who has successfully completed the appropriate training for the activity.  An example of an activity for which there is appropriate training is snorkeling.\r\n\r\n2.) For activities that have no identified training or certification requirements, the Park Superintendent will designate program leaders based on their programming experience, knowledge of the physical area to be used, general safety awareness, and leadership skills.  Program leaders could include permanent staff, seasonals, or trained volunteers.  (It is recommended that the Park Superintendent consult with the District Interpretation and Education Specialist for assistance with training.)   Park Superintendent designation will be restricted to aquatic programs which are inherently low risk activities such as seine pulls, stream walks, and swamp stomps.  For programs which do not fit these low risk criteria, park staff must receive specific authorization from the District Superintendent in order to lead such programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Safety Equipment\r\n\r\nAll aquatic programs must have a park radio and a first aid kit available.  Other safety equipment needs are program specific and include items such as throw floats, life jackets, probing sticks, and flashlights.\r\n\r\nC. Safety Procedures\r\n\r\n1.) Each program must have a leader who has completed the appropriate training or has adequate experience and knowledge to lead the program.\r\n\r\n2.) Each program must have a completed safety plan approved by the Park Superintendent prior to program implementation (See section D below).\r\n\r\n3.) The Park Superintendent will determine the number of staff required for the activity and the program leader to participant ratio.\r\n\r\n4.) The program leader must have a knowledge of the water body being used for 		the program and be aware of how water and weather conditions might change to 		adversely impact the program.\r\n\r\n5.) With assistance from the District Interpretation and Education Specialist, the program leader will develop nondiscriminatory rules of conduct or required skills necessary for program participation.  These rules should be clearly communicated to the public; this would be especially important when they call the park to sign up for a program (ADA requirements).\r\n\r\n6.) The program leader will organize the participants into family groups or the buddy system to help guarantee the safety of all individuals.\r\n\r\n7.) The program leader should communicate the rules of conduct and required skills (if any prerequisite skills are needed) to all participants before beginning the program. The program leader must also inform the participants of the water conditions and review appropriate safety concerns and procedures.  Safety concerns might include dangerous organisms, exposure to UV rays, water currents, number of participants in the water at one time, human-made hazards (glass shards, fish hooks, trash), etc.\r\n\r\nD. Example of an Aquatic Safety Plan\r\n\r\n1.) Activity - Seine Pull\r\n\r\n2.) Location - Tidal pools within 200 meters of an access area\r\n\r\n3.) Staff requirements\r\na) Number of staff - Two\r\nb) Certification - None\r\n\r\n4.) Requirements for Participation (Examples)\r\n$ Ages six through adult; children under age six must be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult.  \r\n$ Ability to negotiate uneven terrain such as mud or sand\r\n$ Ability to comprehend and follow basic aquatic safety rules such as no horseplay in the water, no wading in water above the knees, no swimming.\r\n\r\n5.) Safety Equipment\r\n$ at least one park radio\r\n$ one rescue bag\r\n$ one first aid kit\r\n$ one ring buoy or other flotation device\r\n\r\n6.) Safety Concerns\r\n$ jellyfish\r\n$ other dangerous marine organisms\r\n$ currents\r\n$ approaching storms\r\n$ exposure to harmful UV rays\r\n$ heat exhaustion, heat stroke\r\n\r\n7.) Safety Procedures\r\n$ Group size - maximum of 20 participants\r\n$ Do not exceed a water depth of greater than three feet.\r\n$ Group leader will inform participants of water conditions and safety concerns such as no small children in the water, no touching of dangerous organisms, etc.\r\n$ Should an accident or injury occur, all participants will be required to leave the water.  The emergency medical service system (first aid at the scene or higher) will be activated and the Park Superintendent notified.\r\n', '', '');

(91, '2002-02', '2002-06-26', 'Park Superintendents', 'Philip K. McKnelly', 'Geocaching Policy', 'This staff directive is to establish a policy to manage geocaching.  Geocaching (GPS Stash, GeoStash) involves the placement of a container with various items within it in a specific location and then posting the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) coordinates to a website. Visitors to the website then attempt to locate this container using the GPS. This activity started soon after the U.S. Department of Defense turned off the selective availability of the GPS signals in May 2000.  This improved the accuracy of most recreational GPS units to 10 - 20 meters.  Contents of the container can be anything and typically involves the exchange of items.  Another aspect of this activity is virtual caching.  This does not involve the actual placement of a cache; rather, coordinates are provided for a specific location where there is a unique natural feature, park sign, etc.\r\n\r\n \r\nGeocaches have been placed in our state parks without the approval of park staff.  These placements have resulted in the following concerns:\r\n\r\n?	Caches have been placed in sensitive natural or cultural areas.\r\n	\r\n?	Caches may contain inappropriate or dangerous items.  (One park cache contained prescription drugs.)\r\n	\r\n?	Caches have lead to the creation of spur trails resulting in resource damage and the possibility of visitors leaving established trails and becoming lost.\r\n	\r\n?	Caches may be placed in dangerous or inappropriate areas such as on a cliff or underwater.\r\n	\r\n?	The location of a cache may invite the public into an area we do not inspect for hazards.\r\n	\r\n	In consideration of the above concerns it has been decided to manage geocaching through the use of the special activity permit procedure on a trial basis.  If this activity is found to have a negative impact on the park resources or presents public safety issues the park superintendent may ban geocaching from specific park areas or the entire park.  The following conditions are to be addressed when issuing a geocaching special activity permit:\r\n \r\n	\r\n?	Virtual caches should be encouraged in lieu of physical caches.\r\n	\r\n?	The $25 permit fee is to be waived for virtual caches.\r\n	\r\n?	The person applying for the permit shall provide a valid address and telephone number.\r\n	\r\n?	The cache placement location, including GPS coordinates, must be stated on the permit and approved by the park superintendent to minimize undesirable impacts to cultural and natural resources as well as minimize hazards to the public.\r\n	\r\n?	A specific time period when a cache may be left in place shall be designated to minimize the creation of spur trails.  At the end of the designated time period the cache is to be removed and the web site posting retired by the permit holder.  The actual time period the cache is permitted to be in place will be determined by the park superintendent, not to exceed three months.\r\n	\r\n?	Caches may not be buried, nor may vegetation or stones be disturbed when selecting cache locations.\r\n	\r\n?	Cache containers are to be transparent and have some form of latch or other closure to deter wildlife.\r\n	\r\n?	Contents of the cache are subject to inspection by park staff at any time; park staff will have the authority to remove any items deemed unacceptable.  Examples include food, medications of any type, pornography, weapons of any type, etc.  A log book is encouraged in lieu of exchange items.\r\n	\r\n?	All cache website postings must request the cache searchers to leave a note on their vehicle dashboard identifying the operator as being a geocachers.  Orienteering groups in parks currently do this for safety reasons.\r\n	\r\n	Geocaches and any contents that are removed by park staff are to be documented in a case incident report.  Park staff should periodically review the geocaching websites to monitor caches  placed within the park. \r\n	\r\n	This staff directive is effective immediately.\r\n	\r\n	LRL/tlj\r\n	\r\n	cc:	Superintendent of State Parks\r\n	District Superintendents\r\n	Parks Chief Ranger\r\nSD2002-02', '', '', '', '');

The goals stated in these guidelines should be understood as long-term goals, the fulfillment of which will be an incremental, continuous process.

However, rangers that are willing and able to perform or assist field surveys are encouraged to do so.

Date: Aug 1, 1997 Revised:\r\nPage 1 of 5\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA INTEGRA TED INFORMATION NETWORK AND THE INTERNET\r\nPurpose\r\nTo establish a policy pertaining to the use of the North Carolina Integrated Information Network (NCIIN) and the global Internet by public staffs\r\nBackground\r\nThe Internet is a world-wide collection of interconnected networks. The State\'s wide area network. the NCIIN, is one of many networks connected to the Internet. Electronic tools associated with Internet access, such as electronic mail (E-mail) and the World Wide Web, help public agencies streamline information\r\n \r\n\r\naccess and conduct business. These tools are used with the NCIIN to facilitate inter-agency communication and information processing. These same tools are used for communications between public agencies and entities on the Internet, such as other government organizations, educational institutions, private businesses, and citizens.\r\nThere are many parallels between the new electronic information tools and older technologies used for similar purposes (for example, telephones and written correspondence). As such, the same general concepts of professionalism and appropriate use of publicly owned or publicly provided information processing resources apply.\r\nIncreasing numbers of public staffs now access the Internet. Public use of publicly provided information on the NCIIN is also growing. Public staffs have stewardship responsibilities for public information. The open connection afforded by Internet access underscores the need for heightened awareness among public employees regarding prudent behavior as it pertains to information dissemination and access.\r\nThe Information Resource Management Commission adopted a \"Policy and Guidelines on the Use of the Internet\" on August 2, 1994. That Policy and Guidelines remains the governing guidance to appropriate use\r\nof the NCIIN and the Internet by public staffs. The following policy represents the mandated application of certain aspects of that Policy and Guidelines.\r\nScope\r\nThis policy applies to all government agencies under the authority of the Information Resource Management Commission (IRMC).\r\nPolicy\r\n1. While in performance of work-related functions, while on the job, or while using publicly owned or publicly provided information processing resources, public employees are expected to use the NCIIN and the Internet responsibly and professionally and shall make no intentional use of these services in an illegal, malicious, or obscene manner. Public employees may make reasonable personal use of publicly owned or\r\n2\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nprovided NCIIN or Internet resources as long as:\r\na. The direct measurable cost to the public is none or is negligible;\r\nb. There is no negative impact on employee performance of public duties;\r\nc. The policy is applied equitably among all employees of the agency;\r\nd. Employees shall reimburse the agency if costs are incurred, provided that costs may be incurred only in critical situations.\r\n2. When sending or forwarding E-mail over the NCIIN or the Internet, public employees shall identify themselves clearly and accurately. Anonymous or pseudonymous posting is expressly forbidden.\r\n3. Public employees have a responsibility to make sure that all public information disseminated via the NCIIN and the Internet is accurate. Employees shall provide in association with such information its source and the date at which it was current and an electronic mail address allowing the recipient to contact the public staffs responsible for making the information available in its current form.\r\n4. All files downloaded from a source external to the NCIIN must be scanned for viruses. This includes files obtained as e-mail attachments and by any other file transfer mechanism. It is the responsibility of public employees to prevent the introduction or propagation of viruses.\r\n5. The Internet provides easy access to software distributed by companies on a trial basis.

The need to protect the water resources of the State by appropriately disposing of sewage generated in state parks and recreation areas is an important component of that charge.\r\nDump stations in the State Parks System are designed to accommodate a specific number of campsites. Therefore, the station(s) in any park should be able to accommodate the demand for use by campers from that park. Use of the dump stations by non-campers, however, may over burden the septic system and cause it to fail.\r\nSince the use of state park campgrounds varies so much from park to park, the superintendent of each park shall have the authority to determine if and when the park dump station will be made available to non-campers. If a park is located near a major highway, or the superintendent has other reasons to feel that their park\'s dump station may be over burdened, that superintendent may implement a policy prohibiting the use of the facility by any non-camper. If a park\'s campground is often not filled to capacity, the superintendent may authorize the use of the park\'s dump station by non-campers during times when the campground and dump station are relatively free from pressure. If a superintendent authorizes the use of the park dump station by non-campers, procedures must be established to clearly define when and how the facilities will be available to non-campers.\r\nWhen dump stations are made available to non-campers, all parks shall charge the equivalent of one night\'s camping fee for a recreation vehicle/tent site without hook-ups.\r\nIf you have nay questions about this policy, contact your district superintendent.\r\nPKMlgsr\r\nSigned copy retained by Gina Rutherford, Administrative Section, Archdale Building\r\n', '', '', '', ''),

It is hoped that by recognizing these individuals, the division will foster environmental stewardship, promote an awareness of the state parks system, and encourage North Carolina\'s future leaders to support the preservation of our natural resources. This staff directive is intended to make park superintendents aware of the opportunity to present science fair awards to students in public schools throughout the state who participate in science fairs at the school system level.\r\nAWARD PROCEDURES\r\n1.	In North Carolina\'s public school system, junior and senior division science fairs typically\r\noccur at four levels: school, school system, regional, and state levels. The enclosed science fair certificate may be awarded at the school system level by park superintendents or district staff. A warding the certificate at the school system level rather than in every school will enhance the perceived prestige of the award and require less staff involvement. Notice the blank line on the bottom right side of the certificate for the appropriate signature.\r\n2.	All of the lead I&E rangers should have a current directory of the school systems in your\r\npark\'s geographic service area (GSA). If not, you may contact your district I&E specialist to obtain one. Park superintendents may determine which, if any, or all of these school systems to select and make arrangements to participate in their science fairs. Where multiple parks exist in the same counties or GSA, parks should coordinate their efforts to eliminate the possibility of more than one state park representative presenting awards in\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n-- \r\nStaff Directive 98-9 Page 2\r\nSeptember 15, 1998\r\na particular school system in a given year.

Participation may range from simply working with the science teacher or school system official in charge of the science fair to provide the certificate, to participation at the formal awards ceremony when students and parents are present.\r\n3.\r\nSelection of the recipients should be based generally on concepts of environmental stewardship, interest in the natural sciences, the importance of plant and animal diversity, or the preservation and conservation of natural resources. The decision may be made by the park staff member participating or in concert with the science teacher and/or the science fair judges.\r\nIf additional information is needed, please contact WEDI Superintendent Lewis Ledford who has participated as a regional and state level science fair judge for the past several years.\r\nPKM/LRL\r\nAttachment\r\n', '', '', '', ''),

Division of Parks and Recreation. From time to time people who are not Division employees (such as Department staff, other State officials, or private individuals who have made a significant and long-term contribution to the Division) may be presented with a logo item as an expression of the Division\'s appreciation for their service. Any exception to the policy of restricting the use of logo items to permanent employees of the Division must be approved in advance by the Division Director and will be paid for with Division funds.

These are technical changes to the policies and procedures mandated by changes in the State Personnel Policy. The basic changes give subject employees twelve (12) months to take off overtime as compensatory time and payment in the thirteenth (13) month and allows exempt employees to carry compensatory time for twelve (12) months from the month earned. Exempt employees who lost time during the February/March 1997 time frame will have the time restored under a Special Exemption to the policy.\r\n.No compensatory time is to be worked or taken without the approval of the employee\'s supervisor. Compensatory time will be taken before any sick or vacation leave is taken. Managers and supervisors will be accountable for the amount of compensatory time accrued by their respective sections and the manner in which their employees are compensated. Compensatory time will be taken on the First In-First Out (FIFO) accounting method, such that time taken will be subtracted from the earliest time earned that is still on the records.\r\nFor exempt employees the maximum amount of compensatory leave that may be taken annually is 240 hours.\r\nFor subject employees the maximum amount of compensatory time that may be accumulated is 240 hours (160 hours straight time). Any accumulation beyond 240 must be paid in the employee\'s next normal paycheck.\r\nThe division does not have a significant amount of lapsed salary funds; therefore, it will be expected that managers and supervisors will keep any compensatory time to be paid to an absolute minimum.\r\nIf you have any questions concerning this directive, please contact the Division Personnel Officer.\r\nThis Directive is effective immediately, and shall remain in effect until replaced.\r\nPKM/JBW\r\n', '', 'Attachment Internal Operating Policy', 'SD1997-12,SD1990-08,SD1986-02,', ''),

McKnelly, Director\r\n\r\nSUBJECT:	Procedures for Implementation and Management of the Division?s Facilities Inventory and Inspection Program (FIIP)\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the Division of Parks and Recreation that an inventory of all it?s structures be maintained at all times and this inventory reflect an accurate, current ?picture? of all park structures managed and maintained by the Division.  This staff directive is issued to clarify the roles and responsibilities for the Design and Development staff and Operations personnel for implementation and management of the Facilities Inventory and Inspection Program (FIIP).  Many tasks are necessary to gather the information to maintain an up-to-date listing and evaluation of all park and recreation area structures.  Responsibilities for accomplishment of these tasks are listed below, by section.\r\n\r\nThe Design and development staff will:\r\n\r\n?	Inventory all ?new structures.  ?New? structures are defined as those structures constructed under the Capital Improvements Program, Cost Sharing Agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or similar programs and those structures acquired through the Division?s land acquisition program or by donation to the State.  Acquired structures will be inventoried and recorded within 120 days of acquisition and new construction will be inventoried and recorded prior to acceptance of the structure.\r\n\r\n?	Assign building numbers to all structures located within park and recreation areas administered by the Division of Parks and Recreation.  These numbers will be coordinated with the State Property Office and Department of Insurance and will be used by the park staff in any references to park structures.\r\n\r\n?	Maintain current status of the FIIP database and provide updated printouts to field units by mid-February each year.\r\n\r\n?	Evaluate existing park structures when requested by park staff and recommend rehabilitation or demolition of the structure.\r\nStaff Directive\r\nPage Two\r\nJanuary 8, 1991\r\n\r\n?	Reevaluate park structures periodically, not to exceed five years to insure that the FIIP database is kept accurate and provide Operations Section with current printouts as required.\r\n\r\n?	Invite Division Maintenance Manager and the respective Park Superintendent on the initial inspections for new structures and any subsequent inspections requested by park staff or deemed necessary by Design and Development personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Operations Staff will:\r\n\r\n?	Report all changes, work done to existing (FIIP Inventoried) structures, to the Division Architect.  Any work that changes existing floor plans or that changes the status or use of structures as listed in the most current FIIP report will be transmitted to the Maintenance Manager by field staff.  Changes will be reported immediately upon completion of the project and will be noted on a copy of the corresponding FIIP report and on the structure?s floor plan, when appropriate. (see attachments for detailed instructions).  The Maintenance Manager will maintain these change reports and submit them quarterly, on the first work day of July, October, January, and April, to the Division Architect.\r\n\r\n?	Coordinate any planned work affecting the structural integrity or function of a building, or new construction, with Design and Development.  All other maintenance work will be done in compliance with Design Directive 87-1.\r\n\r\n?	Provide all necessary assistance and cooperation to Design and Development Section in the updating and maintenance of the FIIP database.  The point of contact of all FIIP matters will be the Division Architect.\r\n\r\nThese duties and responsibilities may be modified at any time with the mutual consent of the Chief of Design and Development and the Chief of Operations and the approval of the Director.\r\n\r\nThis staff directive is effective immediately.

Sign materials will vary with location, but can include stone, brick, or wood used in similar fashion as on existing buildings in the park or typical of local conditions.\r\n2.	In general, signs will be made of pressure-treated wood on a masonry base typical of local conditions.  If masonry materials are not common in the area, wood posts or other appropriate materials may be used.\r\n3.	Stain will be used to tone the wood, and a reflective ivory paint will be used in the routed letters.  The stain color will comply with Staff Directive 97-25.\r\n4.	An approved logo may be used on a sign if desired.\r\n5.	Use of color on a sign will be limited to the routed letters and the logo area.\r\n6.

Sign letters should be routed, using the traditional \"Blue Ridge\" style letter.  The routed depth should be at least 2\" deep.\r\n2.	The sign should contain only the name of the park and the name of the Division.  Words like \"entrance\" and \"welcome\" are extraneous and unnecessary.\r\n3.	The name of the Department changes too frequently to be placed on this sign.\r\n4.	All letters will be capitalized.\r\n5.	The sign will have three lines of print.\r\na.	Line one will be the name of the park, in 8\" letters, centered on the sign board.\r\nb.	Line two will be the words, STATE PARK, centered on the sign board, in 8\" letters.\r\nc.	Line three will be the words, DIVISION OF PARKS AND RECREATION, centered on the board, in 4\" letters.\r\nd.	A minimum of 6\" will be between the upper and lower lines of type and any edge of the sign.\r\n\r\nD.	Sign Proportions and Shape\r\n1.	In general, the center wooden portion of the sign will be approximately 5\' by 10\'.\r\n2.	The mass units at each end of the sign of masonry will be piers approximately 3\' by 3\' by 60\".  If these elements of the sign are of other materials, they will also conform to this proportion as near as practical.\r\n3.

Sign Maintenance\r\n1.	Missing, broken, or vandalized signs reflect on the park\'s image and portray an attitude of neglect which, in turn, can lead to further abuse of an area and encourage vandalism.\r\n2.

Davis, Director\r\n\r\nSUBJECT:	Amendment to Staff Directive 88-3\r\n		Clarification of Parks and Recreation Fee Schedule\r\n\r\nDATE:		March 18, 1988\r\n\r\nThe numerous questions raised by the Division?s recently approved fee schedule, Staff Directive 88-3, indicated the need to clarify its application to specific park situations and to address the common concerns of the field staff.\r\n\r\nSeveral parks were concerned about the charge for use of our swimming areas and bathhouses.  The fee schedule lists a swimming fee and this fee will be paid by persons using our pools and other controlled, designated swimming areas.  Where bathhouses are available, payment of the fee is not contingent upon their use; the charge is made for use of the swimming facility.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this fee category, the $1.00 charge for ?children 1-12? should be interpreted as ?children age 12 and under?.\r\n\r\nBoat rental fees will go no higher than $10.00 per day and should read ?$10.00?8 hours or more? during a continuous 24-hour period.\r\n\r\nFamily Camping fees charged for use of family campgrounds were established based on the seasonal demand of the camping facilities and amenities provided.  These fees will be used consistently statewide in all ?family campgrounds? based on classification. The ?off-season? is defined for the basic of this schedule to be that time of the operational year when the amenities or services used to determine the camping area?s classification are reduced or closed.  For our system, this ?off season? is November 15 through March 15.\r\n\r\nThe Division does not administer a Family Group Camp rate.  KELA and JORD will use the appropriate Family Camping fee, based on services available, to charge several families camping together as a group.\r\n\r\nPage 2\r\n\r\nIn response to some expressed concerns that the Group Tent Camping per person fee of $1.00 represented too large an increase, this fee was reexamined but left intact without change.  A review of similar fees charged by other state park systems for the use of similar facilities did find this fee increase reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe Group Camp rental fees will be standardized throughout the system for the first time this year.  Weekly rates will be $250 per group unit throughout the summer, June ? August, and will include utilities.  Minimum rental period is 7 days.  Additional charges of $20.00 per day will be made for use of a mess hall and $20.00 per week for park-furnished utensils when used for the entire week or any part thereof.\r\n\r\nThe daily rental rate per camping unit will apply September through May.  The $75.00 rate will be charged for use of a group camp unit, mess hall, and utensils as a package only; utilities are also included in this fee.\r\n\r\nThe most common question shared by all districts, with the exception of REDI, concerned the reservation of picnic shelters.  Shelter reservation has been a practice for some years at KELA and most recently at JORD and FALA, but this will be the first season it has been implemented on a Divisionwide basis.  Every park superintendent should be aware that our picnic shelters are now available for reservations and will be rented on a reservation basis only.  Shelters not reserved will continue to be free and available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.  Reservations will be taken in person or by mail at park offices and should not be made until the fee is paid.  A fee receipt will be issued by the Park Superintendent as confirmation of the reservation.  Shelters available for reservations will have a lockable ?Reserved? sign and, when appropriate, be designated by a letter, number, or distinctive name.\r\n\r\nMany of you have asked, and I know others are wondering, how to handle the facility reservations made prior to March 1.  You should fully honor those reservations as commitments the Division has already made with the public; the new fee schedule will not be applied to these reservations.  Reservations made after March 1 should reflect the new schedule of fees.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the attention, time, and effort you have given to this schedule and the questions you have raised to insure consistent application of these fees throughout all operating units of our park system.\r\n\r\n\r\nWWD/ebr/jas\r\n\r\n', '', '', 'SD1997-22, SD1988-03', ''),

Clarification or questions concerning this Staff Directive should be directed to the Personnel Officer.\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation is duly authorized to recruit and hire temporary labor and seasonal employees. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each supervisor to adhere to the following guidelines to ensure compliance with DENR Division of Personnel/Human Resources polices and the continuation of Division hiring authorization.\r\nTYPE OF POSITIONS\r\nL - Labor positions are positions that are created for a specific period of time to perform a specific function which is not expected to recur on any cyclical basis. These positions are abolished at the end of the established time period unless an extension (form T-l) has been requested and approved.\r\nR - Recurring positions are positions that are established for a specific period of time and fIlled on a recurring cycle over a number of years. Employees who are returning to the same position at the same salary on the next cycle may be reinstated without further approval by notifying the Division Personnel Officer that they are returning to work.\r\nP - Peakload/Emergency positions are positions created to relieve unusual work demands that cannot be planned for. Peakload/Emergency positions are limited to 16 hours worked per week.\r\n---\r\n- - \r\n-	--	- -	\r\n---\r\n \r\n\r\n-	~	\r\nStaff Directive 97-13 Page 2\r\nJuly 29, 1997\r\nESTABLISHING POSITIONS\r\nThe DENR Division of Personnel/Human Resources will retain the responsibility for classification and pay level. The procedure for establishing, classifying, and extending positions will remain unchanged.\r\nThe Division will submit a T-l form to establish each new temporary labor/seasonal position. The T -1 form will be submitted to the Division Budget Officer for verification of funds and then forwarded to DENR Division of Personnel/Human Resources.\r\nDENR Personnel/Human Resources will evaluate, classify, and assign a title, salary grade, and position number which will establish a permanent record. This will normally be completed within one week from the date the the T -1 form is received in DENR Personnel/Human Resources. If DENR Personnel/Human Resources increases the rate of pay above that proposed, availability of funds will be verified. The T -1 form will be rerouted through the Division Budget Officer for reverification of funds.\r\nDENR Personnel/Human Resources will then send approved copies of the T-l form to the Division Personnel Officer.\r\nRequests for the extension of a position will be submitted to the Division Budget Officer on a T-l form approximately 30 days prior to the original termination date for the position. The Division Budget Officer will verify the availability for temporary salary funds and forward the T -1 form to Division Personnel Officer.\r\nSeasonal and peakload positions have already been established but any new positions will be established as outlined above.\r\nRECRUITMENT AND SELECTION\r\nThe Park Superintendent will advertise all positions with the Employment Security Commission (ESC) for an application period of not less than seven work days. After a position is listed with ESC, the Park Suprintendent shall notify the local office with which the listing is made within 15 days after the position is filled. Colleges, universities, and other available sources will also be notified of position vacancies. Though not required, temporary positions may be listed on the DENR vacancy list.\r\nThe Park Superintendent or supervisor will then screen and interview a minimum of three\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-13 Page 3\r\nJuly 29, 1997\r\napplicants per position and, using an internal recommendation processing form, make a recommendation to the Park Superintendent for approval to hire. In the case where the Park Superintendent does the interviewing, he/she is authorized to hire but will be monitored by the Division. It is of utmost importance to keep accurate records of applicants who apply and for what position in order to adequately defend the hiring process in the event of a grievance or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charge. The Park Superintendent is responsible for this hiring process. A copy of the recommendation form and original applications shall be retained for two years by the Park Superintendent.\r\nThe original recommendation form, along with a copy of the recommended applicant\'s application, will be submitted to the Division Personnel Officer to monitor equal employment opportunity efforts, compile reports, and fIle.\r\nThe Division will be responsible for providing equal employment opportunities for all persons regardless of race, color, national origin, creed, religion, sex, age, disability or political affiliation, except where religion, sex, or age are bona fide job-related employment requirements. To meet Departmental needs, a monthly alphabetical listing of temporary employees currently on the payroll and a quarterly EEO report must be submitted to the Division Personnel Officer. Quarterly report dates end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. Reports from all parks will be combined to make a Division report.\r\nThe Division is delegated the authority to hire and terminate temporary employment; however, termination for cause (dismissal) is to be discussed with Division Personnel Officer for procedures. A warning or suspension may be necessary prior to termination.\r\nPAYROLL\r\nThe Division will submit a new W-4 and 1-9 form, along with a copy of the empoyee\'s driver\'s license and social security card, with the first payroll that the employee appears on. Each park shall submit their payroll with employees listed in alphabetical order on form B&MF P-l.\r\nThe position number assigned by DENR Personnel/Human Resources will be placed on the payroll in the space to the left of the block for the social security number. Any employee, new or old, that does not have an assigned position number listed will not be paid until the appropriate number has been determined.\r\n \r\n\r\n- - \r\nStaff Directive 97-13 Page 4\r\nJuly 29, 1997\r\nLENGTH OF SERVICE\r\nNo temporary employee may be on the payroll for more than 12 consecutive months without a break in service. Following each break in service, they may return for another twelve months of service, provided that the position has sufficient funds and has been so identified.\r\nA break in service is defined as thirty-one (31) consecutive calendar days off the payroll or the numerical equivalent (see note).\r\nNOTE: The numerical equivalent to a 31 calendar day break in service is defined as an employee working less than 1,896 hours in a 12 month period. The 1,896 hours is calculated as 2080 hours (52 weeks x 40 hours) minus 184 hours (23 workdays x 8 hours; 23 being the maximum of 8 hour workdays in 31 calendar days). This will permit positions that cannot be justified as permanent to be used for longer periods of time without forcing financial hardship on employees via a one month unbroken break in service.\r\n\r\nSALARY ADMINISTRATION\r\nTemporary employees will normally be paid at the hiring rate for the salary grade assigned to the position. Any deviation from this policy must be justified on the recommendation form and approved by DENR Personnel/Human Resources.\r\nTemporary employees will not receive performance salary increases during their period of employment. They may be considered for a promotional increase during their period of employment if they move to another position of a higher salary grade.\r\nIn years when legislative increases are granted to permanent employees, temporary employees\' salaries will be increased to the new salary schedule effective October I, providing funds are available.\r\nMONITORING\r\nThe DENR Division of Personnel/Human Resources will monitor equal employment opportunity action and the temporary hiring for the Division to maintain effectiveness and viability in the temporary employment system, as well as to provide technical assistance and guidance in implementing and maintaining the system.\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-13 Page 5\r\nJuly 29, 1997\r\nEXIT INTERVIEW\r\nAn Exit Interview Questionnaire will be provided to temporary employees prior to their departure date.

D., Director \r\nNRCD Application For Leave Form\r\nTO:\r\nFROM:\r\nEffective immediately, the attached NRCD Application for Leave form shall be used when requesting leave. All three copies of\r\nthe form are to be submitted to your supervisor for approval. After leave has been approved, the supervisor retains the original copy, the employee retains the yellow copy and the pink copv is to be attached to the emplovee\'s monthlv timesheet.\r\nA supply of these forms will be kept in the section, district and park offices for employees use.\r\nAs we are implementing the use of these new forms, let me take this opportunity to remind staff of the departmental. policies relating to vacation leave, compensatory (comp) time, and sick leave. While it is important that we work within the policy of . encouraging staff to take the leave time earned to refresh their mental and physical resources, it must be done within the framework established for managing an efficient organization.\r\nVacation Leave - The primary purpose of vacation leave is to give employees a break from their routine work schedules. It can, however, be used for personal illness, absences during adverse weather, or other personal reasons. Vacation leave must always be approved in advance. This does not mean dropping a leave slip on the supervisor\'s desk or putting it in the mail on the way out the door. That practice does not give the supervisor an opportunity to see that schedules are coordinated and the organization\'s work is accomplished. Unless there is an extreme emergency, the leave slip should be submitted, signed, and returned to the employee before the leave period is started. If an emergency does occur, the employee must call the supervisor and request the leave prior to beginning the leave period.\r\nCompensatory Time - Comp time, granted on an hour-for-hour basis, is available to all exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act\r\n(overtime). Most administrative, supervisory, and field staff in the division are exempt. The comp time category was established to give the agency and employee some flexibility in scheduling necessary work. It was not set up as a means to regularly adjust a normal work schedule. An employee must obtain prior approval\r\n-- -\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n-2\r\nfrom their supervisor before either working or using comp time. As with vacation leave, this does not mean putting a note in the mail. It means that a request must be submitted, authorized, and returned before working or using the leave time. Staff Directive 86-2 gives supervisors the authority and responsibility to establish procedures for approving comp time. It also creates a 40 hour cap, which is still in effect, that establishes that once an employee accumulates 40 hours of comp time, they must take some time off before they can work additional comp time hours. This cap is also the supervisor\'s responsibility to manage and control. Comp time is not cumulative. On the last day of February each year, unused comp time is forfeited.\r\nSick Leave - Sick leave was established to provide an employee with time to recover from an illness or injury which prevents them from performing their usual duties. It also may be used for medical appointments for an illness or death of an immediate family member. When the use of sick leave is planned, it must be approved in advance. However, when the sickness or injury is unplanned, the employee must complete the required forms on the first day of return to work.\r\nAll employees are expected to adhere to these guidelines. They are spelled out in the State Personnel Manual, State Employee\'s\r\nHandbook, Staff Directives, and on the NRCD Application:for Leave form. They are designed for both the employees\' protection and the agency\'s effective operation. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.\r\nAny questions concerning the use of this form or clarification of leave policies should be addressed to Judy Warren or Jo Hinton, Division Personnel Section.\r\nWWD: jbw\r\nAttachment\r\nPl\r\n \r\n\r\nADM-03\r\nN.C.

Davis\r\n\r\nSUBJECT:	Research Policy and Process\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation must manage many uses of system resources.  In order to protect resources and users, and to prevent conflicts, it is necessary for the Division to establish a research policy and process.\r\n\r\nPOLICY\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the Division to encourage research activities which are consistent with rules and regulations, management plans, and environmental impact statements associated with units of North Carolina?s State Park and Recreation System.  Furthermore, it is the policy of the Division that scientific research on the lands and waters administered by the Division will be permitted through a Research Activity Permit (RAP) process.\r\n\r\nCRITERIA AND PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe criteria and procedures for implementing this policy are as follows:\r\n\r\nProjects Requiring a Permit\r\n\r\nEffective immediately, a Research Activity Permit will be required for research projects involving:\r\n\r\n?	The collection, removal, destruction, or disturbance of plants, animals, soils, rocks air, or waters of a unit of the State Park and Recreation System for purposes of scientific research.\r\n\r\n?	The placement and use of monitoring stations in a system unit.\r\n\r\n?	The use of park resources, including the time and effort of park personnel.\r\n?	The public, or having an impact on the public?s experience in a system unit.\r\n\r\nInvestigative activity conducted as an unobtrusive by-product of outdoor recreation such as individual bird counts and wildflower photography are encouraged and not subject to the permitting process.\r\n\r\nProcess\r\n\r\nAny person or organization interested in conducting research in a state park should initiate the RAP process by contacting the superintendent of the park in which the project is proposed.  If a proposal involves more than one park the appropriate District Superintendent or the Head of Interpretation and Education should be the initial contact.\r\n\r\nProposals for research activities, such as the collection of a small number of common species, which have minor, short-term impacts on resources or visitors may be approved by individual park superintendents.  Proposals for more comprehensive or long-term projects will be referred to Division staff for review.  This review may take up to 60 days to complete, so all applicants are encouraged to submit proposals at least 60 calendar days prior to the intended beginning date.  The Division reserves the right to limit the period of the permit.  The permit will be suspended or revoked at any time during the course of the project if an investigator fails to comply with the terms of the permit or other park rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe RAP process applies to all research initiated by the Division, as well as proposals developed by other individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\nEvaluation\r\n\r\nRAP applications will be evaluated in relation to the goals of the Division, legal constraints, and the contribution of the research to the information needs of the park.\r\n\r\n1.	Goals\r\n\r\nResearch and collecting in areas managed by the Division will be judged by whether it is appropriate for such activity to occur in a unit of the state park and recreation system.  The principle issue in this decision is whether the research is compatible with the goals of the Division.\r\n\r\nCasual research activities which are entirely non-destructive (such as preparation of species lists without collecting voucher specimens, quadrant sampling involving estimation of plant species cover in non-permanent quadrants, observation of animal behavior, etc.) are generally judged appropriate, since they represent uses of units of the state park and recreation system which are qualitatively no different than many recreational uses.\r\n\r\nMore extensive research projects, such as those involving sampling of biotic and abiotic materials (establishment of permanent plots and monitoring stations, \r\ncollection of large series of specimens, long term studies, collection of a restricted species, and research in a restricted area such as a registered or designated natural area) may be judged appropriate if the benefits of the project are determined to substantially outweigh the potential negative impacts.\r\n\r\n2.	Legal Constraints\r\n\r\nCertain types of research may require compliance with environmental and administrative regulations that affect the resources administered by the Division.  After the initial review of a proposal the applicant will be notified if there is a need for compliance with the following regulations:\r\n\r\n?	Archaeological Resource Protection Act\r\n?	NC Environmental Policy Act\r\n?	Coastal Area Management Act\r\n?	Sedimentation and Erosion Control Act\r\n\r\nIt will be the applicant?s responsibility to provide evidence that all requirements specified by these, and any other applicable laws and regulations, have been fulfilled.  Applicants should be aware that in some cases, compliance requirements can take several months to meet.\r\n\r\n3.	Contribution to the Park and Recreation System Data Base\r\n\r\nResearch that will provide information useful to the future management of a unit of the state park and recreation system or to the development of educational programs in a unit will be actively encouraged and recruited.  In some cases it may be appropriate for the Division to negotiate with researchers to develop a methodology that will generate data that will fit the needs of the Division as much as possible, without  requiring excessive modifications in the researcher?s scope of work.\r\n\r\nProject Approval/Denial\r\n\r\n	Permits may be approved, denied, or conditionally approved with additional terms specified by the Division.  Permits may be suspended or revoked if the project is found to be contrary to Division goals and regulations.  Approved projects will be appropriately signed, numbered, dated and returned to the applicant.  At that time a Division project coordinator will be assigned to the project and all future communication should be with the coordinator.  In cases where a permit is denied the applicant may submit a written appeal to the appropriate District Superintendent or the Division Director when the project involves more than one district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReports\r\n\r\n	Each individual or organization receiving a Research Activity Permit will be responsible for providing the Division of Parks and Recreation with one copy of a comprehensive report at the conclusion of the project.  In addition, annual reports will be required for all projects of more than one-year duration.  Reports should include a statement of goals and objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.  Progress reports may also be required but will be specified when a permit is issued.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITY PERMIT\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\n*							*					*	FOR ADMINISTRATIVE USE ONLY	*	Permit number:		*							*					*\r\n*	Date application				*  					*\r\n*	received:					*					*\r\n	*							*	Date Issued:			*\r\n*	Application approved by:			*					*\r\n*							*  					*\r\n*							*					*\r\n*							*******************************\r\n*	Comments/conditions:								*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n*												*\r\n\r\nApplicant must complete the following items:\r\n\r\n1.

McKnelly', 'Policy for: Rock Climbing Management Within the State Parks System', 'This staff directive is issued to clarify the division\'s policy for rock climbing management within the North Carolina State Parks System. This policy has been developed with the assistance and consultation of numerous division staff and outside sources. It is intended to promote low-impact use in the parks that allow climbing activities.\r\nINTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION\r\nTechnical rock climbing (defined here to include bouldering, free climbing, and direct aid climbing) has occurred in North Carolina\'s state parks since the 1950s, when routes were established in and around Hanging Rock State Park in Stokes County. As climbing increased in popularity through the 1960s and 1970s, climbing became established at three additional North Carolina state parks: Crowders Mountain in Gaston County; Pilot Mountain in Surry County; and Stone Mountain in WIlkes and Alleghany counties.\r\nImpacts to natural resources have been documented since the sport first appeared at Hanging Rock. But given the generally low numbers of climbers, Division of Parks and Recreation (\"division\" hereafter) managers at the time determined that the cumulative effects of climbing-related impacts were acceptable. However, as climbing\'s popularity increased in the early 1970s, the division recognized the need to establish regulations regarding access, designated climbing areas, natural resource protection, and visitor safety. This led in 1973 to the development of the division\'s first climbing policy. It was under this policy that areas such as the Big Pinnacle (pilot Mountain), Hanging Rock (Hanging Rock), and King\'s Pinnacle (Crowders Mountain), remained closed to climbing due to concerns over natural resource protection and visitor safety.\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-3 Page 2\r\nAugust 22, 1997\r\nThe 1973 policy proved effective as long as climber numbers remained low. However, in the decade since the mid-1980s, climbing has emerged as one of the most popular outdoor sports in the United States, and the pressures on climbing areas have increased dramatically. Estimates of active climbers in the United States now approach 500,000, and data collected by the division since the early 1990s indicate that the annual number of climbers visiting North Carolina\'s state parks exceeds 25,000. This growth has been attributed largely to the easy availability of modem equipment, the publication of detailed guide books, a growing climbing press, the proliferation of climbing gyms in urban areas, and increased exposure via entertainment and the popular press (see Attarian 1994 and references cited therein).\r\nSince the mid-1970s, North Carolina\'s state parks have experienced increases in climbing activity similar to those documented in many areas across the country. These increases have been strongly\r\ncorrelated with increased impacts to natural resources in and around climbing sites, both on and off\r\nthe rock surfaces. These impacts typically include soil compaction, vegetation trampling and loss, erosion, unauthorized trails, litter, and disruption of wildlife. In addition to long term impacts on natural resources, increased climbing activity has resulted in concerns about conflicts between climbers and non-climbers, safety, and the general degradation of any visitor\'s outdoor experience due to overcrowding.\r\nSlow-growing impacts that were previously manageable and acceptable due to the low traffic in climbing areas have now been accelerated to the point that the sport and the resources that support .\r\nit are being affected in ways that warrant active management. Since the environmental impacts associated with climbing typically occur in heavily used, confined areas, they can be difficult to mitigate. Long term planning and monitoring are essential if impacts to these sites are to be controlled. Consequently, the Division\'s primary concern has shifted from one of allowing climbing to occur with relatively little oversight to one of more actively integrating climbing\'s growth with the mandates of preserving and protecting ecologically significant areas.\r\nIn order to insure the long-term protection of the state park system\'s natural resources and to ensure that visitors continue to utilize designated climbing areas safely and with minimal impacts, the management of all rock climbing activities in the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation will be guided primarily by the following documents:\r\n1.	The State Parks System\'s Mission Statement.\r\n2.	The division\'s Natural Resource Management Policy.\r\n3.	The division\'s Rock Climbing Management Policy.\r\n4.	Specific park climbing management plans.\r\n- \r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-3 Page 3\r\nAugust 22, 1997\r\nThe division\'s rock climbing management policy is intended to promote low-impact climbing and must strike a proper balance between two criteria:\r\n1.	The need to manage natural resources so that their long-term integrity is maintained.\r\n2.	The need to provide opportunities for safe, high quality outdoor recreation.\r\nThese criteria are addressed by the Mission Statement for the North Carolina State Parks System, which states in part:\r\nThe North Carolina state parks system exists for the enjoyment, education, health, and inspiration of all our citizens and visitors. The mission of the state parks system is to preserve and protect\r\nrepresentative examples of the natural beauty, ecological features, and recreational resources of statewide significance; to provide outdoor recreational opportunities in a safe and healthy environment; and to provide environmental education opportunities that promote the stewardship of the state\'s natural heritage.\r\nThe methods and management philosophy used to protect the state parks system\'s natural resources are guided by the division\'s Natural Resource Management Policy, which states in part:\r\nThe preservation of significant resources shall have priority in the management of park resources.\r\nNatural resources will be managed by allowing natural environments to evolve through natural processes with minimal influence from human activities. The primary objective in natural resource management will be the protection of natural resources for their inherent integrity and for appropriate types of enjoyment while ensuring their availability to future generations. Division managers will attempt to maintain all of the components and processes of naturally evolving ecosystems. Intervention may occur in order to correct or compensate for the disruption of natural\r\nprocesses by human activities; to protect, restore, or enhance rare species and natural communities; or to protect, restore, or enhance significant archaeological resources.\r\nPOLICY\r\nThe Departmental rule concerning rock climbing states that \"a person shall not engage in rock or cliff\r\nclimbing or rappelling in any park except at designated areas in designated parks and only after obtaining a special use permit from a park official.\" (15AN.C.A.C. 12B .0204). Rock climbing and rappelling will be allowed in designated areas in the following North Carolina state park units: Crowders Mountain; Hanging Rock; Pilot Mountain; and Stone Mountain. Each of these parks also contains cliff areas that are designated as off limits to climbers.\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-3 Page 4\r\nAugust 22, 1997\r\n( \\\r\nViolators of climbing and other regulations and laws on park property are subject to prosecution resulting in fines and/or imprisonment in accordance with G.S. 113-23 (Control of State Parks in North Carolina); 113-34 (Rules Concerning Public Use on State Park Lands); 113-35 (Control Over Parks); and North Carolina Administrative Code 15A, Chapter 12B (State Park Regulations). The following standards will apply for all parks with designated climbing areas:\r\nGeneral Information\r\n.	New routes are not allowed.\r\n.	All climbers must register and keep in their possession a valid rock climbing/rappelling permit\r\n	every time they climb in a state park.\r\n.	Climbing and rappelling are allowed in designated areas only and must coincide with a park\'s\r\n	posted hours of operation.\r\n.	Temporary, seasonal, or permanent closures of individual routes or specific climbing areas\r\nmay occur to protect natural or cultural resources or for visitor safety.\r\n.	Unroped climbing is not recommended.\r\n.	The use of fixed anchors is limited to those already in place. Existing fixed anchors may be\r\n	replaced for reasons of climber safety, but only after notifying the park superintendent.\r\nClimber Safety\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation recognizes, as should all climbers, that all climbing activities are inherently dangerous. Further, it is impossible for park staff to guarantee the safety, experience, or ability of any climber. Division staffwill not inspect or certify the climbing equipment or ability of any visitor. Nor will division staff certify any route\'s difficulty rating or the reliability of any fixed anchor.\r\nPark visitors climb at their own risk and are responsible for their personal safety while climbing on state park property. Climbers are expected to secure proper equipment and training, and are further expected to adhere to standard climbing safety practices. Safe climbing demands that each climber have experience in route finding, route protection, rope handling, retreat from steep faces, and emergency first aid.\r\nThe following warnings will be posted on park information boards at all climbing access areas:\r\n.	North Carolina state parks do not create or maintain any climbing route.\r\n.	North Carolina state parks do not install or maintain~fixed anchors on any route.\r\n.	Route selection and the decision to rely on fixed anchors are the climber\'s responsibility.\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-3 Page 5\r\nAugust 22, 1997\r\n.	Climbers climb at their own risk and are responsible for obtaining proper equipment and\r\ntraining.\r\n.	New routes are not allowed.\r\n.	Existing fixed anchors may be replaced only after notifying the park superintendent.\r\nFixed Anchors\r\nNumerous climbing routes in North Carolina state parks have been established using fixed anchors, primarily expansion bolts and pitons. Responsibility for the installation, inspection, and long term maintenance of these anchors rests completely with the climbing community. The division makes no claims as to any fixed anchor\'s condition or reliability and does not guarantee that any fixed anchor is still in place.\r\nIt is the division\'s intent to limit the impacts in all climbing areas by encouraging low impact climbing. Therefore, upon the approval and implementation of this policy, the installation of fixed anchors or the development of new routes will be prohibited at all climbing areas in North Carolina\'s state parks system.\r\nThe replacement of existing fixed anchors for reasons of safety wiD be allowed, but must be preceded by notification of the park superintendent. Upon such notification fiom the climbing community, park staffwill immediately post information at climbing access areas advising climbers that the division has been informed that suspect anchors may be present on a specific route. The ltesource Management\r\nProgram, the appropriate District Superintendent, and the Division Safety Officer will be notified of the request and given the opportunity to comment. Upon agreement among division staff to allow the replacement, the park superintendent will notify representatives of the climbing community and request their assistance.\r\nIf representatives of the local climbing community are not known to park staff, then in accordance with Section 11.3 of the Volunteer Program Guidelines (Determining Volunteer Resources), the park superintendent will consult with organizations specializing in climbing issues, such as local outfitters,\r\n	the Carolina Climbers Coalition, Outward Bound, The Access Fund, etc.	The selection and\r\ncertification of all anchor replacement team members will be the responsibility of the consulting organization(s). All anchor replacements will be done on a volunteer basis by members of the climbing community; park staff will have no role in anchor replacements beyond logistical coordination and record keeping. Prior to the project\'s initiation, all climbers performing the repairs\r\n. will be advised in writing by the park superintendent of the following points (see Appendix 1 for\r\n	sample notification):\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-3 Page 6\r\nAugust 22, 1997\r\n( \\\r\n.	Their status as volunteers means that the State will not provide medical coverage or worker\'s\r\n	compensation for any participant who is injured during the replacement project.\r\n. All climbing equipment, tools, anchor hardware, and any other costs associated with anchor\r\n	replacements are to be provi<l~_g by the climbing community.\r\n. Park staff must be notified prior to the initiation of the project, and all work must occur\r\n	during posted park operating hours.\r\n	. Old anchors are to be completely removed and carried out. When possible, old anchor holes\r\n	will be redrilled and reused. Otherwise, old anchor holes are to be sealed with a mixture of\r\n	epoxy and rock dust. The replacement must occur as close as possible to the old anchor site.\r\n	. On completion of the project, climbers will provide the park superintendent with written\r\n	documentation on anchor location, condition, type, date and method of installation, and who\r\n	performed the work.\r\nPark Specific Climbing Plans\r\nIn addition to these division-wide standards, each park with climbing areas will develop a climbing management plan that provides for the following:\r\n1. Information on designated climbing areas, park hours, where and how to obtain a climbing\r\nand rappelling permit, access routes to climbing areas, and emergency assistance. 2. A program to monitor and evaluate climbing impacts on the park\'s natural resources. 3. Voluntary involvement and support of the local climbing community.\r\nPark management. plans may also address ~,s: limits, temporary, seasonal, or permanent closures, weather-related closures, natural or cultural resource management and protection, or any other issue deemed pertinent to resource protection or visitor safety.\r\nPOLICY REVIEW AND REVISION\r\nAt a minimum, each park plan and the Division\'s policy will be reviewed on a five year rotation by the Resource Management Program, the Division\'s Safety Office, the appropriate District Superintendent, and the Superintendent of State Parks. Such reviews will also consider and incorporate input from division field staff, the division\'s Resource Management Program, the Attorney General\'s Office, park advisory committees, and representatives from the local climbing community. Specific responsibilities for these reviews are included in Appendix 2.\r\n(\r\n \r\n\r\nStaff Directive 97-3 Page 7\r\nAugust 22, 1997\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\nBouldering: Climbing that occurs on rock faces usually less than 20 feet high. Typically involves repeating a sequence of moves up or across a rock face. Usually done without a rope.\r\nDirect Aid Climbing: Climbing in which the climber is completely dependent on the rope for support and safety. Progress is made by installing protective anchors (usually removable) in the rock and then relying on them to support the climber\'s weight as the climber stands on them and reaches up to install the next anchor.\r\nFixed Anchor: Climbing protection that is installed and intended to be left as a permanent fixture on a route. The most common examples include pitons, which are hammered into cracks, and expansion bolts, which are drilled into smooth rock faces.\r\nFree Oimbing: Climbing in which the climber relies on the rope only for safety. Progress is made by using the hands and feet on the natural features. Anchors are typically used, but only to stop a fall; they are not used as climbing aids.\r\nRappelling: Using a rope to descend ITom a steep slope or face.\r\nREFERENCES\r\nAttarian, A (1994).

The park staff is responsible for planning special interpretive programs and observances at the park during the year.  In so doing, it will be guided by the appropriateness of the event with regard to the interpretive themes and historic time frames of the park.  Other considerations for special programs and observances will be the availability of funding and personnel, policy conflicts, media publicity, operational impacts, and logistical concerns, as determined and approved by the Park Superintendent.\r\n\r\n2.	To be considered for participating in a special event, a volunteer or living history reenactment group must submit a detailed written proposal describing its program and how it will participate in the event.  Park staff will evaluate the appropriateness of the activity and capabilities of the individual or group.  For first-time appearances in a park, the individual or group is required to submit a resume of qualifications, including references (five are recommended) from previous sites and events where it has performed.  Living history reenactment groups or individuals must meet standards of authenticity in uniforms, weapons, and equipment suitable for the historic period they are required to portray, to the satisfaction of the Park Superintendent.  They must also meet Division standards of safety to the satisfaction of the Park Superintendent.  \r\n\r\nIn the case of historic weapons firing, the individual or group must meet the standards of safety as described in the Regulations for Historic Weapon Demonstrations at State Historic Sites and be supervised by a Division employee who has received at least 16 hours of classroom and practical training in the use of historic weapons at state historic sites.  Groups acting under a special use permit and not participating in the Division=s volunteer program are also required to carry liability insurance and provide proof of this coverage.\r\n\r\n3.	The group or groups whose proposals and references are deemed most appropriate for a special event will be determined and selected by the park staff, and invited to attend the event.  Participation in an event is done solely on an invitational basis from the park.  The park is under no obligation to invite every group which applies to attend an event, nor to provide other programs on an Aequal time@ basis to other groups or individuals.  The Park Superintendent will inform groups that are not selected of the reasons why their proposal was not accepted.\r\n\r\n4.	During a special event, a group or any of its members may be removed from the event at the discretion of the Park Superintendent, or any of the park staff, for violations of contract, event guidelines, authenticity, safety, or park regulations.\r\n\r\n5.	Special events with the volunteer or living history groups involving any payments of monies, demonstrations with dangerous weapons such as firearms or edged weapons, or lasting a duration of more than one day will be performed on a contract basis using a form contract through the Concessions Manager of the Division of Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\n6.	Park staff will complete a program evaluation of the individual or group following the event and furnish copies to the District Superintendent and the group.  Form IE-6 in Appendix G of the Division=s Interpretive Program Guidelines could be used as an evaluation instrument.  The evaluation will include a specific recommendation, based upon their performance, on whether or not the group should be invited to future events.  Strengths or weaknesses should be noted for the information of the group and future event sponsors.\r\n', '', ''),

McKnelly, Director\r\n\r\nSUBJECT:	Designating Mount Jefferson as a State Natural Area\r\n\r\nMount Jefferson State Park?s General Management Plan recommends that the area?s designation be changed to ?state natural area? because of it?s natural significance and it?s extremely limited potential for facility development (operations evaluation attached).  In accordance with that recommendation, this directive makes that designation official.\r\n\r\nEffective immediately, the new name for Mount Jefferson is ?Mount Jefferson Natural Area? and the classification is ?conservation area,? which will allow such activities as picnicking to continue at the site.\r\n\r\nPKM/cjt\r\n\r\nAttachment \r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPARK OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nOperations Evaluation\r\n\r\nThe major concerns addressed in the general management plan process are identified by Division of Parks and Recreation staff as the plan is initiated.  These issues are classified into three operations.  This section deals with the park operations issues and recommendations.  Four major management and operations issues have been identified as being of significant concern at Mount Jefferson State Park.  These are:\r\n\r\n1.	Should Mount Jefferson be classified as a state park given its size, limited potential for development, and natural significance.\r\n2.	Are the current operating hours appropriate?  Mount Jefferson opens one hour later and closes one hour earlier than most other state parks.\r\n3.	What visitor safety measures are appropriate at the overlooks on the road to the summit?\r\n4.	Is the trail system adequate given the park?s size and natural resources?\r\n\r\nSHOULD MOUNT JEFFERSON BE RECLASSIFIED AS A STATE NATURAL AREA?\r\n\r\nIssue Statement:  Mount Jefferson?s classification as a state park should be reconsidered because of it?s small size, limited potential for development, and natural significance.\r\n\r\nBackground:  Mount Jefferson has limited potential developing visitor facilities because of the steep slopes that dominate the park.  Current visitor facilities are limited to a park office, a picnic area, exhibits, and trails.  Prior to the general management plan, only a visitor center and picnic shelter were needed to complete the planned development.\r\n\r\nA 470-acre Registered Natural Heritage Area is contained within the boundaries of this 489-acre park.  The rock outcrops at the summit and the mature forest communities on the northern-facing slopes are particularly significant.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:  Mount Jefferson State Park should be reclassified as a State Natural Area because of its natural significance and limited potential for development.  The reclassification will occur upon approval of this general plan.  According to the Administrative Code for the state natural areas, Mount Jefferson should be classified as a conservation are, which allows the picnicking facilities and trails that currently exist.\r\n\r\nOPERATING HOURS\r\n\r\nIssue Statement:  Is it appropriate to open Mount Jefferson State Park one hour later and close one hour earlier than other state parks in the system?\r\n\r\nBackground:  Mount Jefferson State Park is operated as a satellite of New River State Park.  The operating hours at Mount Jefferson have been reduced in the past so that one staff member can open and close both parks.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:  Mount Jefferson State Park should continue to open one hour later and close one hour earlier than other state park units.\r\n\r\nSAFETY MEASURES AT OVERLOOKS\r\n\r\nIssue Statement:  A steep cliff is located near the parking lot at the second overlook on the park road to the summit.  What are the appropriate visitor safety measures needed at this location?\r\n\r\nBackground:  An automobile guardrail exists at the second overlook, but no pedestrian railing is there.  No accidents have been reported at the site.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:  A warning sign is needed at this location.  The warning should be consistent with the Attorney General?s opinion by stating clearly the danger that exists and the injuries that could occur if the warning is not heeded.\r\n\r\nTRAILS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIssue Statement:  The trail system, totaling about 1.2 miles, is not sufficient to provide public access to the 489-acre park.\r\n\r\nBackground:  The trail system consists of approximately 1.2 miles of designated hiking trails.  Both trails, the Luther Rock Trail and the Rhododendron Trail, originate in the summit parking lot.  A trails evaluation resulted in the recommendation to build new hiking trail.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:  A new loop trail should be explored from the first overlook to the caves on the western side of the mountain.  A second trail should extend the Luther Rock Trail to the southeast and the return by connecting into the Rhododendron Trail.  These trails should be two-foot wide dirt trails.  The routing and trail impact need to be determined with the assistance of the Natural Resources Section.\r\n', '', '', '', ''),

Recognition for a job well done significantly reinforces an employee?s satisfaction, morale, and the enjoyment of being a ?contributing member of the team?.  It also encourages other employees to strive to excel.\r\n\r\nIt is my personal goal that we show our appreciation to the employees that provide the outstanding service often associated with our Division and I can think of no higher honor than being recognized for outstanding character or services by ones peers.\r\n\r\nOur Division?s Awards Program has been established to recognize this competence, dedication, and innovation; and to instill the sense of involvement.  However, each of you must participate through the nomination process, and some to the extent of serving as a member of the Awards Committee, to provide appropriate recognition of all deserving employees.  By working together, we can make this program truly meaningful to division staff and supporters.\r\n\r\n				Sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n				Philip K.

McKnelly, Director\r\n\r\nSUBJECT:	Smoke Free Work Place\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue of a smoke free work place has been an item of concern to me for some time now.  Major health studies have determined that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increases the risk of lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers.  The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that ETS is a Class A carcinogen.  In the interest of providing a safe and healthy work environment for all division employees, I have decided to designate all Archdale office space occupied by the division and the conference room as a smoke free work place.  This policy will go into effect November 28, 1994.\r\n\r\nDivision employees who want to smoke while on the job should do so in the northwest stairwell which is vented to the outside or outside the Archdale Building.  The department has implemented a policy against smoking in the restrooms.\r\n\r\nState employees normally spend nine hours a day at their job site.  One hour of that time is usually a lunch break, leaving eight paid work hours per day.  While the State Personnel Manual does not contain a policy on work breaks, it has been common practice to allow a break of ten to fifteen minutes in the morning and afternoon.  Effective immediately it will be the policy of the division to allow one fifteen minute break in the morning and one fifteen minute break in the afternoon when workload and time permit.  Decisions concerning the appropriateness and timing of specific breaks will be made by the supervisor.\r\n\r\nIf you feel you must have a cigarette and cannot adhere to the length of time between breaks then you must arrange with your supervisor to schedule no more than (3) five minute breaks in the morning and no more than (3) five minute breaks in the afternoon.  The total break time shall not exceed the fifteen minute time frame for the morning or afternoon.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in breaking the smoking habit, several agencies are available to provide assistance.  For information about those agencies and their programs, please contact Paul Hash at 715-4522.\r\n', '', '', '', ''),

The Division workplan is important to our being able to justify our workload and helpful to every employee in know?ing how she or he relates to the job to be done. Over the past several months, we have all worked very hard to prepare a comprehensive work plan based on a cenceptual framework of how we shall manage the Division.\r\n\r\nWe must now put into place a mechanism for revising existing work elements, or adding new work elements to the workplan. Therefore, the following process shall be utilized by anyone wishing to revise, delete, or add work elements to the work plan.\r\n\r\nStep One. Develop the loqic. The proposer should list in their cor?rect order the individual job steps which make up the project. Do not be concerned with how long the jobs will take nor who, or what, is needed to complete them. The steps are to be listed on Attachment One.\r\n\r\nStep Two. Develop a Networkinq Chart. Once all of the activities necessary to complete the job have been identified, a graphical representa?tion of how the job steps need to be completed is prepared and this in?volves the construction of a network. Jobs will be arranged in their correct sequence, and how they depend upon each other will be shown.\r\n\r\nStep Three. Timings. The next step is the estimation of the duration of each job. Place this information against the job description in the proper blank on Attachment Two and against the representation of each job on the network. For example of how a networking chart is completed, See Illustration One.\r\nStep Four. Analysis. The network is now analyzed to determine the start and end time in manhours. Additionally, the critical path is deter-mined. in any project, there is one sequence of jobs that is longer than any other and this determines how long the project will take. The network\r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nmust identify what the critical path is for the work element and illustrate this by use of a dashed line connecting the sequence of blocks on the net?work which requires the greatest number of man hours.\r\n\r\nStep Five. Schedulinq. The proposer will identify a \"must have\" date for the work element and show it on Attachment Two. The proposer will take that date and, using the estimates already prepared, back out days to show a \"must start by\" date. This is accomplished by using the critical path. Last, the proposer must identify the resources necessary to accomplish the project, whether it be fiscal or manpower, and show the work element steps where thoseresources are required. This is done on Attachment Two.\r\n\r\nStep Six. Determine Mandate. The proposer shall identify the legis?lative mandate for the work element and attach a copy of pertinent sections to the package, as shown on Attachment Three. In addition, a tie-in to the SCORP Action Plan must be shown.\r\n\r\nStep Seven. Review and Approval. Once the entire package is complete, the proposer will submit it to the Division\'s senior management, which con?sists of the Director, Deputy Director, and Section Chiefs_ This group will make a recommendation to the Director after reviewing the proposal. If the work element is accepted, it is sent to a technical advisory group for more detailed refining. It is then returned to the Director for his scheduling. It is expected that the proposer shall present the work element package in person to the senior staff at a meeting called for this purpose and he will be expected to defend and justify the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe directive is in effect until further notice. No work can be under?taken by the Division until it has been formally reviewed through these procedures. \r\n', '', '', 'SD1986-03,SD1997-08,', ''),

These positions are abolished at the end of the established time period unless an extension (T-1) has been requested and approved.\r\nR Recurring positions are positions that are established for a specific period of time and filled on a recurring cycle over a number of years. Employees who are returning to the same position at the same salary on the next cycle may be reinstated without further approval by notifying Division Personnel office that they are returning to work.\r\n\r\nP Peakload/Emergency positions are positions created to relieve unusual work demands that cannot be planned for. Peakload/Emergency positions are limited to 32 hours worked per two week pay period.\r\n\r\nESTABLISHING POSITIONS\r\nThe EHNR Division of Personnel will retain the responsibility for classification and pay level. The procedure for establishing, classifying and extending positions will remain unchanged.\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation will submit a T-1 form to establish each new temporary labor/seasonal position. The T-1 will be sent to Fiscal Management for verification of funds and then forwarded to EHNR Personnel.\r\n \r\n  \r\nStaff Directive 91-8 Page Two\r\n\r\n\r\nEHNR Personnel will evaluate, classify and assign a title, salary grade, and position number which will establish a permanent record. This will normally be within one week from the date received in EHNR Personnel. If EHNR Personnel increases the rate above that proposed, availability of funds will be verified. The T-1 will be rerouted through Fiscal Management for reverification of funds.\r\n\r\nEHNR Personnel will then send approved copies of the T-1 forms to Fiscal Management and the Division of Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\nRequests for extensions of positions will be submitted to Fiscal Management on a T-1 form approximately 30 days prior to the original termination date for the position. Fiscal Management will verify the availability for temporary salary funds and forward the T-1 to Personnel.\r\n\r\nSeasonal and peakload positions have already been established but any new positions will be established as outlined above.\r\n\r\nRECRUITMENT AND SFT.FCTION\r\n\r\nThe Park Superintendent will advertise all positions with the Employment Security Commission for an application period of not less than seven work days. After a position is listed with ESC, the local with which the listing is made shall be notified by the Park Superintendent within 15 days after the position is filled. Colleges, universities and other available sources will also be notified of position vacancies. Though not required, temporary positions may be listed on the EHNR vacancy list.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation will then screen and interview a minimum of three applicants per position and using an internal recommendation processing form, make recommendation to the Park Superintendent for approval to hire. In the case where the Park Superintendent does the interviewing, he is authorized to hire but will be monitored by the Division. It is of utmost importance to keep accurate records of applicants who apply and for what position in order to adequately defend the hiring process in the event of a grievance or EEOC charge. The Park Superintendent is responsible for this hiring process. A copy of the recommendation form and original applications shall be retained for two years by the Park Superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe original recommendation form along with copy of each application will be submitted to Division of Parks and Recreation Personnel to monitor affirmative action efforts, make report to EHNR Personnel and file.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation will be responsible for developing affirmative action goals and recruitment of minorities in order to meet those goals. If all recruitment efforts fail to get minority applicants, a detailed explanation must be submitted to substantiate all efforts made. To meet departmental needs, a monthly alphabetical listing of temporary employees currently on the payroll and a quarterly EEO report must be submitted to Division of Parks and Recreation Personnel. Quarterly report dates end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. Reports from all parks will be combined to make a Division report to EHNR Personnel.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation is delegated the authority to hire and terminate temporary employment; however, termination for cause (dismissal) is to be discussed with Division Personnel for procedures. An oral warning or suspension may be necessary procedure prior to termination. The immediate\r\n \r\nStaff Directive 91-8 Page Three\r\n\r\nsupervisor will be responsible for Step 1 grievances. At Step 2, the Division Director\'s decision will be final.\r\n\r\nPAYROLL\r\n\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation will submit a new W-4 and 1-9 form with the first payroll that the employee appears on.\r\n\r\nThe position number assigned by the Division of Personnel will be placed on the payroll in the space to the right of the block for the social security number. Any employee, new or old, that does not have an assigned position number listed will not be paid until the appropriate number has been determined.\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF SERVICE\r\n\r\nNo temporary employee may be on payroll for more than 12 consecutive months without a break in service. Following each break in service, he/she may return for another twelve months of service provided the position has sufficient fund and has been so identified.\r\n\r\nA break in service is defined as thirty-one consecutive calendar days off payroll or the numerical equivalent (see note).\r\n\r\nNOTE: The numerical equivalent to a 31 calendar day break in service is defined as an employee working less than 1,896 hours in a 12 month period. The 1,896 hours is calculated as 2080 hours (52 weeks x 40 hours) minus 184 hours (23 workdays x 8 hours; 23 being the maximum number of 8 hour workdays in 31 calendar days). The will permit positions that cannot be justified as permanent to be used for longer periods of time without forcing financial hardship on employees via a one month unbroken break in service.\r\n\r\nSALARY ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nTemporary employees will normally be paid at the hiring rate for the salary grade assigned to the position. Any deviation from this policy must be justified on the recommendation form and approved by EHNR Personnel.\r\n\r\nTemporary employees will not receive performance salary increases during their period of employment. They may be considered for promotional increase during their period of employment if they move to another position of a higher salary grade.\r\n\r\nIn years when legislative increases are granted to permanent employees, temporary employees\' salaries will be increased to the new salary schedule effective October 1, providing funds are available.\r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\nStaff Directive 91-8 Page Four\r\n\r\nMONITORING\r\n\r\nThe EHNR Division of Personnel will monitor affirmative action and temporary hiring of the Division of Parks and Recreation to maintain effectiveness and viability in the temporary employment system as well as provide technical assistance and guidance in implementing and maintaining the system.\r\n\r\nEXIT INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nAn Exit Interview Questionnaire will be provided to temporary employees prior to their departure date.

STATEMENTS OF CRITERIA\r\n\r\n1.	The Director will accept applications from any citizen or group of citizens who wish to recommend the naming of a facility or area in honor of a person, historical event, natural phenomenon, or geographical location.\r\n\r\n2.	The Director may recommend the name of an individual for a particular area or facility when that individual has made exceptional contributions to the state.

The name must not duplicate, nor be exceptionally similar to any other name existing within the State Park and Recreation System so as to cause confusion to the public.\r\n\r\n5.	When a proposed name is for an individual who is no longer living, the Director will not consider that request unless a period of at least one year has elapsed from the death of the individual.\r\n\r\n6.	When the Director determines that the contribution of a particular individual warrants his or her name be associated with a facility or unit that already has a name, the Director may add that name to the existing name.  Such an addition to a facility may not be made until at least five years has elapsed from the time of the original naming of the facility.  Only one additional name may be added and no more than two names may be given to any facility.\r\n\r\n7.	Recognizing that it is appropriate to change names of a park or facility under certain conditions, the Director may change the name of a park or facility after a minimum of 100 years.  This time frame applies only to those facilities that have been named for an individual.\r\n\r\nV.	PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n1.	When naming or renaming a facility, the Director will accept proposals in writing.\r\n\r\n2.	Proposals to the Director for naming a facility or site shall have a petition with at least 100 signatures of adult residents in support of the request.\r\n\r\n3.	A proposal for changing the name of an existing facility by addition of another name or a complete change shall require a petition with at least one hundred (100) signatures of adult residents in support of the request.\r\n\r\nVI.	OTHER\r\n\r\n1.	The Director may place a plaque at an appropriate location within a park or facility whereby the names of individuals may be placed for their contributions to the Division when the Director finds that it is inappropriate to name a facility or park for the individual.\r\n\r\n2.	When there has not been a suggested name for a new park or facility at its completion, the Director may determine an appropriate name.\r\n\r\n3.	In the event there is organized opposition to a request, the opposition shall also have to complete a statement of opposition identifying the reasons for their opposition.  Organized opposition shall also follow the general requirements in opposing a request as the proponents followed in making the request.\r\n\r\n4.	The Division will post notice at the site of a facility or unit to inform the public of the name change request.\r\n\r\n5.	Certain features in parks should be named for such things as flowers, birds, or animals instead of people.  Consideration for naming these items should be at the discretion of the Director, upon recommendation from staff.\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', ''),

This policy has been developed with the assistance and consultation of numerous division staff and outside sources. It is intended to promote low- impact use in the parks that allow climbing activities.\r\nRock climbing (defined here to include bouldering, free climbing, ice climbing, and direct aid climbing) has occurred in North Carolina\'s state parks since the 1950â€™s, when routes were established in and around Hanging Rock State Park in Stokes County. As the popularity of rock climbing increased, it became a common recreational activity at three additional state parks: Crowders Mountain, Pilot Mountain, and Stone Mountain. Today, rock climbing also occurs at Chimney Rock State Park. Additional climbing areas may be added in the future, subject to DPR approval.\r\nAs rock climbing\'s popularity increased, DPR recognized the need to establish guidelines regarding access, the designation of climbing areas, natural resource protection, and visitor safety. This led to the establishment of the first DPR climbing policy in 1973. This policy established designated climbing areas. Several modifications have been made to the guidelines since their inception in 1973. These most recent changes specifically address the increased demand for group climbing at North Carolina State Parks. The guidelines outline the process of obtaining a group climbing permit and the requirements for group climbing at NC State Parks. This process will ensure that both group and individual climbers can enjoy their outdoor experience.', '', '', '', ''),

Generally, overnight absences from the park residence should be infrequent and not prevent the employee from routinely providing the after hours emergency response intended by the presence of resident employees.\r\n \r\nException to this policy may be granted by the chief of operations when it is demonstrated to his or her satisfaction that one or more of the following conditions exist:\r\n1)	The structural integrity and/or the internal building environment are unsafe for occupancy;\r\n2)	The residence is too small for the park superintendentâ€™s or rangerâ€™s family and cannot practically and economically be modified to meet their needs; and\r\n3)	The chief of operations determines that just cause exists to allow an exception based on extraordinary circumstances that may arise which cannot, at this time, be anticipated.\r\nAny exception to this policy must be justified in writing to the chief of operations and reviewed by all supervisors in the chain of command. Considerations for approval of exception include:\r\n1)	There must be a commissioned employee available to occupy the park house in the place of the employee requesting the exception for reasons 2 and 3 above;\r\n2)	The requirement to live in park housing would become a condition of employment, tied to a \r\nspecific commissioned park position, and would be determined by operational need; and\r\n3)	If the employee granted the exception is the superintendent, there must be a commissioned employee with appropriate training and experience within the park, available to occupy the park house as a condition of employment, with the understanding that he/she would be required to vacate the house when the next superintendent is appointed. Other considerations as may be necessary.\r\nDistrict superintendents have the responsibility to enforce this policy and take corrective measures to rectify situations which violate this policy. Additional district superintendent responsibilities include:\r\n1)	Determining whether park housing is satisfactory, safe and sanitary for occupancy;\r\n2)	Maintaining a district housing list and forwarding this information to the division personnel technician as changes in staff housing are made;\r\n3)	Ensuring that annual inspections are conducted; and\r\n4)	Working with any housing resident to ensure the relevant parkâ€™s needs are being met.\r\nEmployees are responsible for all utilities and a monthly service and maintenance fee established by the Division and payable through payroll deduction.

Moderate stress can be beneficial to peopleâ€™s lives however; stress can be difficult to live with when it is the result of a bad or difficult experience.\r\n\r\nThe potential exists for traumatic events to occur in our lives and jobs while working with a public agency such as the Division of Parks and Recreation.  These events may have physical, mental or emotional impact on the employees involved.  Research indicates that early intervention with affected employees can reduce the impact of a traumatic event on oneâ€™s life and expedite a healthy recovery.  The mental and physical health and safety of Division employees is of the highest priority.  This policy will give guidance to supervisors during a critical or traumatic incident in order to offer assistance to any employee involved in a traumatic event.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael A. Murphy\r\n1.0	PURPOSE\r\n\r\nTo establish policy and procedures for providing support for employees and family members involved in critical incidents.  Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) is a systematic approach to assist affected staff members cope with the loss, trauma and stress of a traumatic incident through the use of a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD), which is specially designed and offered to employees who are affected in the workplace.\r\n\r\nThe debriefing process has both psychological and educational components; however it should not be considered psychotherapy.  It is a structured group meeting in which participants are given the opportunity to discuss their thoughts and emotions about a traumatic incident in a structured environment.\r\n\r\nA traumatic event may have physical, mental or emotional impact on the individuals involved.  Research indicates that early intervention can minimize the impact of a traumatic event on a personâ€™s life and can actually expedite a healthy recovery.  The expected outcome of trauma response activities is to reduce the occurrence of post-traumatic stress responses in employees who have experienced a traumatic event.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0	POLICY\r\n\r\nIt shall be the policy of the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation to provide peer and professional support for employees and families of employees involved in work related critical incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0	DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nEmployee:  Any employee of the Division of Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\nFamily Member:  Any immediate family of any employee that is involved in a traumatic incident or has knowledge of such incident that is work related.\r\n\r\nTraumatic (Critical) Incident:  An incident that creates significant stress, anguish, physical or psychological pain, fear or other harmful effects to an employee(s). A traumatic incident may involve one of the following but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Use of force situations in which there is death or serious injury of any involved person.\r\nâ€¢	Death of an employee.\r\nâ€¢	Vehicle accident with death or serious injury to any person.\r\nâ€¢	An employee involved in an incident that due to the nature of the incident overwhelms the employeeâ€™s ability to safely perform their duties.\r\nâ€¢	Accidental discharge of a firearm resulting in an injury.\r\nâ€¢	Serious injury of an employee.\r\nâ€¢	Incidents involving unusually large number of victims.\r\nâ€¢	Any occurrence that is unusually stressful or distracting and would be improved by appropriate intervention by the critical incident stress management program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Assistance Team (EAT):  NC Division of Parks and Recreation employees who have been trained in a certified program as Peer Support Counselors and the State Employeeâ€™s Assistance Program (EAP) Consultants that are contracted by the Office of State Human Resources (OSHR) who will facilitate / help facilitate the debriefing.\r\n\r\nDefusing:  A brief intervention by the incident commander or site supervisor within a few hours after a critical incident.  The purpose is to provide employees directly involved with the incident a chance to verbalize immediate concerns and to be made aware of the common after effects of a critical incident.\r\n\r\nDebriefing (CISD):  A structured group meeting in which participants are given the opportunity to discuss their thoughts and emotions about a traumatic incident in a structured environment with a licensed mental health professional present.  It is preferred that debriefings are facilitated by EAP Personnel or a licensed mental health professional assigned / contracted by the EAP.\r\n\r\nAllied Agency or Division:  Any city, county or state agency or division requesting or providing assistance with peer support personnel in a CISD.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0	PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe purpose of CISM is to support employees who are involved in traumatic incidents.  No activities by the Employee Assistance Team (EAT) shall be considered part of any investigation or operation critique.  EAT personnel will not interfere with administrative or criminal investigations following traumatic incidents.  Traumatic incidents listed in Section 3.0 will be reported to the District Superintendent.  The fact that an employee is involved in one of the traumatic incidents does not preclude or require him or her from participating in the defusing or debriefing.  Employee Assistance Program (EAP) personnel or their representatives and EAT will state a warning to employees involved in the defusing/debriefing process that they should not make any statements of fact that may be important to any criminal or administrative investigation.  The CISD process is intended to address the human emotions associated with this type of traumatic incident.\r\n\r\nThe EAT will adhere to the formal defusing and debriefing formula.  No Peer Support Personnel will provide advice or recommendations that should be given by a licensed medical professional.  Information from defusing, debriefing and one-on-one counseling sessions gained by EAT will be held in confidence with the following exceptions:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Information suggesting the employee is a danger to him or herself.\r\nâ€¢	Information suggesting the employee is a danger to another person.\r\n\r\nCritical Incident Stress Management (CISM) and Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) operations are a component of the Incident Command System (ICS).  The ICS was developed primarily for forest services and wildland management agencies for the purpose of managing wildland fires.  However, from the beginning, the system was designed to be flexible enough to handle all forms of emergencies besides fire, including search and rescue, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other disasters.  Because of this flexibility, ICS has become a standard for incident management.  In the event of a major incident the Incident Commander may be responsible for coordinating efforts with the Parks Chief Ranger (PACR), a District Superintendent or designee for a critical incident stress debriefing with division personnel before demobilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0	ACTIVATION \r\n\r\nUpon the occurrence of critical incidents involving employees of the Division of Parks and Recreation, the immediate supervisor of the involved employee(s), and / or the Park Superintendent will contact the Parks Chief Ranger (the District Superintendent may handle if the PACR is unavailable) who will activate the CISM program if it is determined that CISD and the EAT is needed after consultation with the District Superintendent and other supervisors.  This notification will be made as soon as possible after the incident.  Information on the nature of the incident, the involved employees, the time and location of the incident and the current status of the incident will be provided to the Parks Chief Ranger (or District Superintendent if applicable).  In the event that the Parks Chief Ranger or District Superintendent is involved in a critical incident, one of the other District Superintendents will be asked to activate the CISM Program, contacting the Employment Assistance Program and coordinate the Divisionâ€™s EAT operations.\r\n\r\nThe Parks Chief Ranger (or the District Superintendent if applicable) will determine the resources needed to provide the defusing and/or debriefing of the involved employee(s) and if immediate or delayed response by the Divisionâ€™s EAT is required.\r\n\r\nThe Parks Chief Ranger (or District Superintendent if applicable) will contact Peer Support personnel from the Divisionâ€™s EAT to determine availability and the number of personnel needed for a possible deployment if activation is needed.  One EAT member will be asked to take the Divisionâ€™s lead role in the debriefing.  The nature and scope of the traumatic incident will be given to all responding EAT members.\r\n\r\nActivated EAT personnel responding to a debriefing will travel in Division Uniforms and vehicles and will be considered to be on-duty for the duration of the activities.  The Parks Chief Ranger (or District Superintendent if applicable) who made the initial activation call to EAT personnel will designate the dress of the day for the debriefing.\r\n\r\nUpon deployment, Division personnel will be under the supervision of the Parks Chief Ranger.  For each incident the Parksâ€™ Chief Ranger will designate an Employee Assistance Team (EAT) Leader who shall be responsible for all administrative and operational procedures during the deployment.  The EAT Leader will coordinate all EAT activities, in conjunction with assigned EAP Personnel, once on-site at the Park involved in the critical/traumatic incident. \r\n\r\nDebriefings will be held in facilities not associated with the Park or Division if possible but regardless should be held in a location that is private and provides a â€œsafeâ€ place for participants to step away from the debriefing if they are feeling overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nIt will be the practice that the Division will offer all employees involved in critical / traumatic incidents the services of the Stateâ€™s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and the Divisionâ€™s CISD program.  The Parks Chief Ranger (or the District Superintendent) may request an evaluation from a designated psychologist or the Employee Assistance Program via the Chain of Command for a recommendation as to the fitness for duty of an employee involved in a traumatic incident.  This evaluation will help to determine if the employee is capable of serving in his or her job capacity if the Divisionâ€™s EAT, the EAP Personnel or its contractors, informs the Division that an involved employee is a danger to him/herself or others. \r\n\r\nThe Employee Assistance Team (EAT) Leader will document the debriefing with a Case Incident Report (PR-63) with all the appropriate information and coding with the exception of the involved employee names.  The EAP Facilitator and Peer Support personnel can be documented\r\n\r\nIn the event another State agency or division, or any city or county government unit makes a request to the Division of Parks and Recreation for personnel assistance with Critical Incident Stress Management, the Chief of Operations will make a decision to provide personnel or assistance to those requesting agencies based on availability of Division resources.  \r\n\r\nA committee consisting of the Employee Assistance Team and co-chaired by the Parks Chief Ranger will review the CISM Program annually.  A report of the review with recommended changes to operational activities will be provided to the Chief of Operations.\r\n\r\nThe EAT personnel and the committee should attempt to meet at least annually and attend periodic CISM refresher training as Division resources allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0	TEAM MEMBER SELECTION CRITERIA \r\n\r\nIt is the Divisionâ€™s goal to have an Employee Assistance Team (EAT) that can provide trained peer support counselors during a critical incident debriefing that is made up of a diverse group of employees from all job categories. The EAT should be made up of volunteer employees who have a desire to help their fellow employees who may become involved in a traumatic incident in the work place.  With park units and employees spread across the State, it is important to have enough trained peer support counselors that are dispersed across the entire Division.  Although a specific number of trained personnel is not specified, a goal of approximately 12-16 trained personnel is ideal (~3-4 per district).  \r\n\r\nCriteria for EAT Members / Peer Support Counselors\r\nâ€¢	Participation should be voluntary\r\nâ€¢	EAT Members should have at least two years of full time employment as a permanent employee with the Division.\r\nâ€¢	EAT Members should have a â€œMeets Expectationsâ€ or above on their VIP Work Plan and shall not have any current personnel actions in their personnel file.\r\nâ€¢	EAT Members should be of good moral character and understand the importance of the programâ€™s confidentiality.\r\nâ€¢	EAT Members must have the approval of their immediate supervisor, Park and District Superintendents.\r\nâ€¢	Division employees who are interested in becoming a EAT / Peer Support Counselor should submit a memorandum of interest through their chain of command to the Chief of Operationsâ€™ office for approval.\r\n\r\n7.0	CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS DEBRIEFING NOTIFICATION/ ACTIVATION REQUEST FLOW CHART \r\n\r\n\r\nField Staff / Field Supervisor\r\n\r\n\r\nPark Superintendent \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict Superintendent and Parks Chief Ranger\r\n\r\n\r\n				Chief of Operations\r\n\r\n				\r\n				Division Director\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision Employee Assistance Team (EAT) for Availability *(Typically 2-3 members are needed depending on the number of Park staff involved in the incident)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP)\r\n(McLaughlin Young Group â€“ (888-298-3907 - 24/7 Hotline)\r\n\r\n(Coordination of EAP and/or contracted licensed professional and the Divisionâ€™s EAT team to incident debriefing) \r\n	\r\nDivision Employee Assistance Team (EAT) as of July 2015\r\nAngelia Allcox			Peter Mitchell\r\nLee Amos			Jane Conolly\r\nKelley King			Karen Johnson\r\nJohn Schell\r\n\r\nGuideline History\r\nOriginated:	R.

Monetary or High-Value items: When property such as cash, credit cards, checks, or any high-value items are found, they should be immediately reported and turned over to the park superintendent or park ranger in charge, who will secure the items in a locked safe or other secure area. The office assistant will enter each item into the DPR lost and found database (including the date the item was found, a description of the item, etc.) for tracking purposes. \r\n\r\n2.	Non-monetary items: When items such as keys, clothing, toys, or any other item not falling into the previous category are found, they should be turned into the park office for the office assistant to enter each item into the DPR lost and found database (including the date the item was found, a description of the item, etc.) for tracking purposes. These items are to be held in a single area designated for non-monetary lost and found items.\r\n\r\nLost Property:\r\n\r\nVisitors should be advised to report lost items to the closest park ranger or park staff member. Park staff should check the designated lost and found area and the lost and found database to see if similar items have been found. If similar items have been found, make no assumption of ownership, as the potential owner must clearly identify the item without prompting. If the item being inquired about is not in the designated lost and found area or database, a â€œLost Property Reportâ€ should be completed and turned into the park office to be kept on file.

The Division Safety Officer has developed the following information to provide clarification:\r\n\r\nSeasonal/Temporary Staff Vehicle Operations\r\nSeasonal employees under 18 years old cannot drive Division motor vehicles under the Federal Child Labor Law.  The US Department of Labor office in Raleigh has advised that this includes ATV\'s.  They further advise that employees under 18 years of age may not operate utility type vehicles such as \"Gators\" or golf carts on roadways.  Use of these vehicles off of roadways by employees under 18 years of age should in general be avoided.  Park superintendents may use their discretion to allow individual 16 and 17-year-old employees to operate golf carts or vehicles such as \"Gators\" off of roadways if it necessary for park operations.  Obviously, adherence to all safety guidelines is necessary. Community service workers are prohibited from operating any agency vehicles.\r\nSeasonal/Temporary Staff Power Equipment Operation\r\nSeasonal employees 16 to 17 years old are restricted as to what power equipment they may operate under the Federal Child Labor Law.  Equipment operation that is permitted:\r\n\"	Riding mowers.  Cannot be driven on park roads as transportation.\r\n\"	Trimmers, i.e. \"Weedeater\" but with string attachment only.\r\n\"	Gas powered blowers/vacuums.\r\n\"	Push mowers.\r\n\"	Outboard motor on a boat.\r\n\r\nPassengers in Division Vehicles\r\nPassengers may only be transported in Division owned or leased vehicles for official park business.

Consistent with this obligation, officers should take a preventive approach, whenever possible, if observing behavior that suggests that another officer is about to engage in unlawful or inappropriate behavior, as described more fully below.\r\nOfficers working for the Division of Parks and Recreation have an ethical and legal duty to intervene when necessary to prevent or stop another officer from using a level of force that the officer knows, or should reasonably be expected to know, is excessive or unwarranted under the existing circumstances. Officers shall also intervene in any case where the officer observes another officer treating a member of the public in any manner that is inconsistent with law or policy (i.e. conducting an unlawful detention or making an unlawful arrest). This duty also extends when the officer is called to assist, or is assisting, any other law enforcement agency.\r\nFailure to intervene, as required by this policy, may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\r\nDUTY TO REPORT\r\nDivision of Parks and Recreation officers shall immediately notify a supervisor after conducting any type of intervention, when safe to do so.\r\nDivision of Parks and Recreation officers also have a duty to immediately report any unlawful or otherwise inappropriate conduct when observed or when learned about. Notification shall be made to a supervisor, documented, and submitted through the Chain of Command and/or established internal affairs process.\r\nAll types of interventions whether physical or verbal shall be documented and submitted through the Chain of Command and/or established internal affairs process.\r\nFailure to report, as required by this policy, may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. /kn', '', '', '', ''),
