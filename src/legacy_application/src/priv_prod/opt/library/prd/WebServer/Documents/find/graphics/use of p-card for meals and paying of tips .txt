Subject:	use of p-card for meals and paying of tips 

Please see below from DENR Controller's Office about paying of tips when 
paying for meal during travel status.
Thanks,
Tammy
TIPS (meals)
You can not pay for Tips with the P-card. If you chose to pay a Tip that will 
have to be out of pocket with no reimbursement. Tips for meals are not allowed 
on the P-card.................  PLEASE SEND THIS EMAIL TO YOUR CARDHOLDERS 
listed on the P-card log.  I'm seeing allot of the same mistake being made on 
the P-card by some of the same cardholders.  To avoid losing their P-card let 
the cardholders know they have to follow the policy.  Thank you!  Teresa White
