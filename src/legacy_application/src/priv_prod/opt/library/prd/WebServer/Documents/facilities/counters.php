			Welcome to the  <b>DPR Traffic / Trail / Visitor Center Counter</b> application.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program is being used to survey the parks system to determine the <strong>existing</strong> number and function of counters. It will also help in identifying additional counter needs. Counters could also be deployed in a park's Visitor Center.
		</p>
		<p>
			It will allow for compiling the time needed to check counters and the distance from the main park office along with comments concerning each counter.
