Subject:	DEPOSIT RULES (URGENT)

Importance:	High

If you are not following the rule of going to the bank when you reach the 
amount of $250, please begin to do so.  No large park should be going to the 
bank only once a week unless you have not reach $250.  
State Auditors are looking at our deposits and some have found not to be in 
compliance.  Please do your best to abide by the rule and if not, please have 
a logged justification as to why you had an exception.  
Below is the State Statute that we must abide by. 


> c. State Treasurer Approved Exceptions to the Daily Deposit and 
> Reporting Act An exception to this requirement of daily deposit of 
> funds is granted to divisions and offices having receipts less than 
> $250.00 daily.
> Funds are deposited at least weekly for checks or cash and any day 
> when funds total $250.00 or more per approval from the Office of State 
> Treasurer under the authority of G. S. 147.77.
The entire policy can be read at the below website and begins on page 5:

Tammy
